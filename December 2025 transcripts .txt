Here is the transcript of the psychiatry session based on the audio text provided, using the names **Dr. Lavanya** and **Partha**.
**Partha:** Hello.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hi. How are you?
**Partha:** I'm fine, ma'am. How are you?
**Dr. Lavanya:** I'm fine. You're in office?
**Partha:** Yes, ma'am. I am in office.
**Dr. Lavanya:** You're in office today. You have privacy to talk?
**Partha:** Yeah, yeah.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. I just saw your message. Obsessive thoughts reduced, feeling generally more stable, able to handle disappointments, canceled plans without major upset. This was an issue, is it?
**Partha:** Uh, I mean... that was not an issue. Disappointment was not an issue. The issue was like obsessive thinking and suicidal thoughts. And those were reduced actually.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Wait, wait, I didn't understand. Obsessive thinking about?
**Partha:** Uh, the ex-girlfriend.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Yeah, yeah. But "disappointments without major upset," that part?
**Partha:** That... yeah, I used to be like I have to make up my mind if something goes wrong. Like, that I used to be. But now I don't care. So whatever happens, okay, I'm okay with that.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. Hmm. Getting good sleep. Okay. Still tired most of the time despite good sleep. Sleep medication causing nightmares and dreams, I take it rarely. Which one are you taking?
**Partha:** Lemborexant.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Oh, you're taking 5mg still? On and off?
**Partha:** Yes, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Not daily.
**Partha:** Not daily.
**Dr. Lavanya:** How many times in a week might you take it?
**Partha:** I haven't taken in a month or so, but yesterday and day before yesterday I took.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay. Yeah. Sometimes it happens that, you know, it can cause nightmares if you take it consistently for a while, but it's a little bit... Okay. So it's causing nightmares on the night that you take it, is it?
**Partha:** Yeah.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Uncertainty about whether medication is actually working or just circumstances. What does that mean?
**Partha:** Uh, I mean right now I have so much work to do. Both in office as well as uh, in my... in my shop. So... so that could be a reason that I am feeling distracted, right? But logically speaking, there is some sure difference between the previous dosage and current dosage of medication. I really feel that uh, so much things have reduced.
**Dr. Lavanya:** But like part of me is feeling like uh, it could be circumstantial than the actual working of medication. So that's what I am feeling.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. Hmm. Okay. When you said shop, what uh... which shop is this? Like, you have not told me about the shop at all.
**Partha:** Oh yeah, we have a photo studio. Like my parents have that. So even there also I used to like work something. If they want something to be done, I'll do that there. Like, so recently we have so many works. Like whenever I go home or something, I was doing that work. So I have something to think about constantly instead of thinking about other things, I was focusing on the work. So that could be a reason that I am not thinking about other things.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Yeah. Okay. But are you interested in like the photo studio, working there?
**Partha:** Uh, I mean I just want to help them. I'm not interested in the... in the way... I'm just wanted to help them like that.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. Hmm. Important questions to ask: Is the persistent fatigue normal or concerning? Um, can you describe the persistent fatigue to me? So are you tired all the time?
**Partha:** Yeah, most of the times I'm tired. And I couldn't wake up from the bed. Like it's very hard for me to wake up from the bed because uh, like I wanted to sleep more even though if I slept well, I want to sleep more.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Is this only on the days that you take the Lemborexant or even otherwise?
**Partha:** Even other days. Actually, I have so much dreams every day. Even though if I don't take Lemborexant, I have so much dreams. But the... some dreams are very scary only when the... when I take medication.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. Hmm. What time do you take the Aripiprazole?
**Partha:** Aripiprazole... both Aripiprazole and Sertraline I am taking at morning. Morning like 9 to 10.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Uh, what time do you actually go to sleep?
**Partha:** Uh, 10:30 to 11:30.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. And you fall asleep immediately?
**Partha:** No, it will take around half an hour or one hour, I guess.
**Dr. Lavanya:** What do you do during that time?
**Partha:** Nothing I'll do. I'll just uh... just lay on the bed and stay silent.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay. But you have that residual drowsiness in the morning is what you're telling me.
**Partha:** Yes. Yes, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** How long does that last?
**Partha:** Uh, kind of uh, like next half day. Like till noon something.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. What time... You wake up at what time?
**Partha:** Sometimes 7, sometimes 8.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. Okay. Groggy till noon, is it?
**Partha:** Yeah.
**Dr. Lavanya:** What if you have like a cup of strong coffee or tea in the morning?
**Partha:** Yeah, then I will feel better. But I prefer... I don't prefer taking coffee usually. I don't drink coffee also. I have been try... I mean like for last two days I drank it. But still uh, I mean I am just scared that if I drink coffee I may not sleep properly. Like uh, what happened two days ago was I didn't sleep at all. Like whole... whole night. So that's why I took Lemborexant the next day. So yeah, that could be a reason because I was drinking coffee at the...
**Dr. Lavanya:** If you drank coffee in the morning... No, no. When you took coffee in the morning, you didn't sleep the whole night, is it?
**Partha:** Uh, no it's not morning though. It's around 5... I mean like around 12 o'clock I guess.
**Dr. Lavanya:** No, no. I am saying, let's say you get up in the morning, you start your day with a coffee.
**Partha:** Okay.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Then also would the same thing happen?
**Partha:** No, I haven't tried that, ma'am. I have to try that.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Try that and see. Before we change anything, because you're saying that in other aspects it's better. Then we may not have to rely on Lemborexant also. Okay?
**Partha:** Yeah, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** That's why. Because otherwise we'll have to look at other options in the morning. Before we look at adding another medication, I was thinking maybe we can try this.
**Partha:** Yeah.
**Dr. Lavanya:** But definitely going up on the Sertraline has helped you, you're saying.
**Partha:** Yes, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm? Now whether to distinguish whether this is because of a situational change or because of uh... whether it's because of actually an improvement because of medication. Okay? Now there is always going to be a confounding factor of the thing that you have also become busy and preoccupied with another aspect along with your work. And work is also keeping you busy. It is well known that sometimes patients with OCD require higher doses of SSRI to show improvement. Okay? And 250mg to let's say 300mg of Sertraline have also been studied. Okay? In people with OCD. It's not commonly prescribed but when let's say 200mg is not cutting it, sometimes we may want to go up. And that's what we did in your case. Alright? It is also known that not being *khali*, which means not spending a lot of free time, is very very helpful. Which means that the more that you are occupied, the more that you are busy, the less there is a chance for your obsessional thoughts to come back. Okay? So in general, the dictum is don't wait for your OCD to go away or don't wait for your OCD to get better to start living your life. Start getting busy and start getting preoccupied as much as you can. Don't wait for things to improve.
**Partha:** Yeah.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Before you do anything. Okay?
**Partha:** Sure.
**Dr. Lavanya:** So I don't have a clear cut answer for that. But my sense is it's probably a combination of both of these factors.
**Partha:** Okay.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Probably a combination of being occupied and a higher dose of medication.
**Partha:** Sure.
**Dr. Lavanya:** So I think regardless of that, given the fact that we know that both of these are helpful, I think it's better for you to stay busy and stay occupied in both ways. Okay? Now knowing that Lemborexant is giving nightmares, let's try to avoid it as much as possible. What helps you with sleep otherwise? Was uh, Quetiapine or Clonazepam helping you with sleep?
**Partha:** Uh, I think Clonazepam was helping me but not always. Clonazepam is better than comparatively to Quetiapine.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Compared to Lemborexant?
**Partha:** I mean even Lemborexant also doesn't make me sleep actually. Like, what I am saying is uh, I used to feel sleepy uh, during initial stages like when I used to take Clonazepam, I used to feel sleepy. Like I... I will know that I am going to sleep. But uh, now... nowadays uh, like none of the medications if I take also I feel like uh, I feel awake only. I am not feeling like uh, drowsy and all. Maybe uh, I don't know like it is taking some time or what. I don't know if I take earlier than before I sleep, something like that.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. No, I think given the fact that it's causing these kind of uh, you know, doubts and these kind of nightmares, it may not be the best choice at this point in time. So let's stop it. Clona... You have any more with you?
**Partha:** No, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Enough, don't take any more. We'll keep Clonazepam SOS. Okay? 0.25 is enough or you want 0.5?
**Partha:** Umm, I stopped at 0.5, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** 0.5... the only thing is that you might feel a bit groggy or drowsy in the daytime. So if you're taking 0.5 then you have to take it a little earlier.
**Partha:** Okay, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay? Hmm. Now, uh, the other thing that I need to ask you is have you been to Coimbatore again? Because that was the primary trigger, right?
**Partha:** Uh, I mean actually it's Chennai and uh, I am going this week actually. For a concert.
**Dr. Lavanya:** You're going there. Okay.
**Partha:** Yeah. So let... let's see what's happening. I don't know exactly. I mean I'm going with my friends so I don't think there will be much triggers.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Sure. Sure. Sure. Okay. All right. So I think definitely we will stop the uh, Lemborexant. We'll keep Clonazepam SOS only. Okay? Which means as and when required. We will use uh, Sertraline and Aripiprazole as it is. Mood wise how are things?
**Partha:** Uh, I mean uh, around 70 to 75% I am feeling okay.
**Dr. Lavanya:** You're feeling okay?
**Partha:** Yeah.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay. Fine. You're able to focus and work, all of that?
**Partha:** Yeah, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Fine. No major side effects with Sertraline increased dose or anything, no?
**Partha:** Yeah, no major side effects.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. All right. Okay. So we'll do Clonazepam 15... instead of Lemborex... Clonazepam 0.5 instead of Lemborexant. Okay? Stop Lemborexant.
**Partha:** Sure, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. You can pick up the Clonazepam prescription from uh, this thing only, Koramangala Docube only. Because sometimes you'll not get it elsewhere.
**Partha:** Okay. Yeah.
**Dr. Lavanya:** When is your next with Krishna?
**Partha:** Uh, I mean I think she is sick I guess. So...
**Dr. Lavanya:** Yeah, yeah. She started working in Koramangala, man. You can come and see her. You schedule with her.
**Partha:** Okay, ma'am. Sure.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Huh?
**Partha:** Yeah, I will check with that.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. What about OCD improvement if you had to quantify? How much improvement would you say? Leave aside cause and effect. Just tell me overall if you had to quantify.
**Partha:** Uh, I still have thoughts but it's not that much intense and uh, it's around 65 to 70% of improvement I would say.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Nice. That's very, very reasonable. Okay. Okay. Good. So I think let's just wait. Okay? We'll... You go to Chennai, you come back. We'll see how things are once you're back. You put a message to me on chat and tell me how you're doing.
**Partha:** Sure, ma'am. Sure.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay? All right. And I'll send you a prescription now. Uh, reach out to Krishna and see. Okay? I think she started working from Koramangala this week so you can probably check with her.
**Partha:** Sure, ma'am. Sure, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** All right. When are you going to Chennai?
**Partha:** Uh, this Saturday.
**Dr. Lavanya:** This Saturday. Okay. Fine. So maybe when you're back you can maybe connect with her.
**Partha:** Okay, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay? All right. Good. I'm glad that certain things are better. But uh, this fatigue thing I think just try that early morning when you get up just have a tea or coffee and see if that helps certain things. Okay? Otherwise maybe tweaking the timing, so maybe taking the medication even a little bit earlier in the day.
**Partha:** Okay, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** And we'll see. Okay? And we'll stop the Lemborexant for sure.
**Partha:** Sure, ma'am. Sure.
**Dr. Lavanya:** All right, Partha. See you. Bye-bye. Have a nice day. Bye.
**Partha:** Thank you. Bye, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.
**Dr. Lavanya:** Bye.




Here is the full transcript of the conversation with the speakers identified as **Krishna** (the counselor) and **Partha** (the client).

**Krishna:** Hello.

**Partha:** Hello, ma'am.

**Krishna:** Hi Partha, good morning. Am I audible?

**Partha:** Yeah, you are audible, ma'am. How are you, ma'am?

**Krishna:** Yes, much, much better, Partha. I started working a few days back. I was just going to drop you a message on the day you booked the session. So, yes. Thank you for waiting, Partha, and apologies for needing to cancel as well in the last moment.

**Partha:** It’s okay, ma'am. It’s okay.

**Krishna:** Yes. So, how are you doing, Partha? It's been some time, isn't it? Three weeks, I think, close to about three weeks.

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, ma'am.

**Krishna:** Yes, yes. So please catch me up to speed. How are you doing?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, I feel... I was feeling better actually. So, I even told Lavanya ma'am about that I have about 75% improvement since the last month because of the increase of dosage. And then... and then it was all totally fine. What happened was, suddenly I had some trigger, and then I spoke to her, and I was crying that day.

**Krishna:** When was this, Partha?

**Partha:** This is around like last week, I guess. Last week... yeah. It was happening like that. And then, after crying and all, I spoke to some other person and I was okay, I was normal. So, like that shift, like that sudden shift from crying and becoming normal, it was new because before and all it will take so much time for me to come out of that. But now it's like easier.

**Partha:** And then this weekend... like the last weekend I went to Chennai for a concert. Concert with my friends. Uh, yeah, I can say like 40% I can manage. Remaining 60% there was like triggers were there and like I kept telling about her to them and this is what happened. Because the concert which I went, no? Previous time I went with her to the same concert. So, yeah, that obviously will be there, those memories will be there, no? So, yeah, that was there. Apart from that... I'm okay. I can... even though if I have some thoughts and things, I can manage now. Yeah.

**Krishna:** All right. Can you tell me about both these triggers a little bit more, Partha? So I'm able to understand. What was the trigger for you when you had to call her and you cried and other things?

**Partha:** Uh, I just... I mean... suddenly I felt like... I saw some Instagram reel, I guess. I don't remember exactly what it was. But that made me feel like... you should... it's like "you should deserve someone who is... who will say that I don't want to lose you, let's fix this," like that. So, that thing... I ended up calling and asking like, "Can we talk one more time and can we fix this?" Like that. But that ended up in me crying and all.

**Krishna:** On call with her itself, Partha?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah, ma'am.

**Krishna:** And what happened in that conversation? How did she navigate that situation?

**Partha:** I mean, she was talking politely only. She was telling that it's not my fault or it's just about incompatibility and nothing else. Like, "I didn't hate you" and all. She told everything. She just trying to explain her point of view and like why she left. But I can understand, but still I couldn't accept it. So because... and then I gradually cut the call after some time.

**Krishna:** Right. Was it immediate, Partha? So if we look at the trigger and the reaction—so the reaction that you had was calling her, right? Was it immediate? As soon as you saw the trigger, I mean as soon as you watched the reel, did you immediately have a conversation with her? Or how did that sort of happen for you?

**Partha:** It's like 10-15 minutes. Maybe mostly it's immediate only, I guess.

**Krishna:** Hmm. Almost immediately you had to sort of have that conversation as such, is it?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** Didn't try anything in that meantime? Like say for example when you started watching the reel, did you understand on... how was it? At what point did Partha realize that this is a trigger for me?

**Partha:** I mean, after calling and speaking and doing everything, I regretted it a lot. Like, why should I do this? Why did I do this? But at that time I was not in control, like it was out of my control. So, like when I saw the reel, and then after like 5-6 minutes, I literally gave up that... like I went to the state where I cannot come out. So it was like I will eventually call her and then I'll speak like that.

**Krishna:** And now looking back, Partha... at what point now do you feel that as I was getting into the reel, right? At what point did you feel it was... how long was the reel for? Was it a video? Was it a shorter reel? Or how was it?

**Partha:** It's just a text based post.

**Krishna:** Okay. All right. And did you continue sitting with that post or did you immediately put your phone away? Or what is it that you did?

**Partha:** I mean, I just swiped up and then I moved to some other reel. But that got stuck in my mind and then I was like, "Okay, we can talk one more time and we can make it fix." Maybe... maybe this can be like... how do I say this? Like that magical thinking where we can think like "this time it will be fixing," like that. So that won't happen. But still, I feel like... like I have betrayed and like all those things. Again, again the same thing will come up, right?

**Krishna:** That *you* have betrayed her, Partha?

**Partha:** No, no, no. That she... she has betrayed me.

**Krishna:** Okay, okay. All right. Right, right. And what about the concert? When was the concert? Was it over this weekend?

**Partha:** Yeah, like this Saturday.

**Krishna:** All right. The thought of going to the concert itself, did that bother you? Or was it after you reached the concert? How was it?

**Partha:** Yeah, it's almost everything. Like going Chennai, going in bus, literally everything. Because I don't usually go to Chennai unless I want to see her. So that's the reason I go Chennai every time. This time if I go with friends and... I ended up talking about her to everyone. Like, that's what I do every time. But this time I was like, "Okay, we went here, we came here." The more I try to resist the thoughts of having like talking about her, the more I talk about her. So it's like opposite whatever I'm thinking of. So, yeah. The trigger was there everywhere. Like if you go concert, you know obviously couples will be there. So that would be one reason. And the songs... like songs and all which she used to like, no? So those songs will be played and you will be eventually sad about that.

**Krishna:** Got it, got it. Right, right. Yeah, no, definitely Partha. But you... I also remember you saying that you bounce back fairly quickly. Tell me about that.

**Partha:** Yeah, I spoke to one of my friends, Sanjana. So like, she scolded me like, "Why did you go talk to her again like after all this? You will never change," and all. Like she just scolded me a little. That's okay. But that made me feel like normal. Again I felt normal because... like this person is new and they don't have anything to do with that old issues, right? So it's like some sort of hope that I can still feel some good connections with other people in spite of having all these things.

**Krishna:** Right. And how about in Chennai, Partha? What were you doing in the concert when the triggers were starting and other things?

**Partha:** Uh, I would say 80% I was in the moment. It's okay, I was fine only. But sometimes... sometimes I just go out of zone and I feel bad. And then I'll feel like... I mean, I'm just scared that I cannot move on or I cannot come out of this ever, like that. That was there. And I couldn't resist the... like resist that triggers. Like if something comes, I'm getting scared. And then I'm just like, "Okay, you have to give in." Like you can't... you can't fight this. So you just have to... I mean, fight in the sense, you don't know how to come out of this. You will eventually go into this and you will suffer, like that. I'm just scared about that.

**Krishna:** When you said you couldn't resist the trigger, Partha, can you... I didn't quite understand that. What did you mean?

**Partha:** If a trigger comes, I don't want to get into it and then think about it and then like drag it and then like talk to it, like question it, like everything I do, right? Whichever is engaging with it. That is the problem I think. But I couldn't stop that.

**Krishna:** Okay, got it. Now I understood. All right. So even though there were triggers and other things, and understandably so Partha, do you feel there was something different about it this time?

**Partha:** Yeah ma'am. I would... uh... different, I cannot say. But the comeback was quicker, I can say. Like I can just come back from that like easier than before. But still... since like if I go to Chennai, obviously the triggers will be more, right? So that can be a reason if I felt overwhelmed. But like I even spoke to my friend's parents. Like they are love married. They were like, "It's okay, don't worry about this." Like they were very chill about this and they were like, "It's okay, you deserve better." Like everybody... everybody who I know, they are happy about this ending. But except me. And... and also I don't want to talk about this with every single person, but I am talking about this always. That is my... one of the major issues. Somehow I end up bringing this person and talking about that person.

**Krishna:** Even now do you feel that is happening?

**Partha:** I mean, it has reduced slightly. Like if you ask me, I would say like if 10 times I have to speak about that person, I'm speaking about 6 times now. Before and all I used to speak like 9 times, 10 times. So now I can reduce to 6 times like that.

**Krishna:** That's still an improvement, Partha, right? Of course we need to work on it a little bit more, but I think it's also okay for us to acknowledge that it is still, still a bit of an improvement. Right? Even now on a daily basis do you talk about her? Or is it only when certain triggers happen for you, Partha?

**Partha:** Mm... Kind of both. Sometimes I just tell what I'm thinking about to someone like "this is what happened," like that. But I don't have to tell that. There is no reason I have to tell about that, right? I'm just telling voluntarily. So that is one side. Other side is like, someone, if someone asks something about her, then I'll tell, like "She dances well." So like, and then they will tell like, "Okay, she's not dumb then. She knows to dance, right?" And then I'll tell like, "Okay, I didn't say that she is dumb, I just said dumb because she was believing in astrology." Like that I'll continue the conversation. So like that it will go. So that could be one of the triggers. And other thing is I will tell voluntarily when I feel something I wanted to say. So both are there.

**Krishna:** Right. Why do you feel that happens, Partha? Let's not think about removing it off right away, right? But I'm curious to know... Is there a part of Partha that's worried whether he's going to forget about her? Or is he going to forget about the situation? Is there a part of you... I'm just curious why is it that you feel there is a need to bring her up in conversations voluntarily? I'm not talking about the involuntary ones. Say for example when I ask or somebody else asks you about her, it makes sense why you have to bring it up, right? But any reason why otherwise, if nobody asks or without any say stimulus, when you bring it up... why do you feel that happens?

**Partha:** It's like I'm constantly comparing my life with her, right? I feel like that. If she goes out, I have to go out. If she buys something, I have to do same thing. Like if she learns to play something, I have to play something. Like I just keep on comparing myself with her. I used to do, and I'm doing now also I guess. And then like if she's getting married, even I should get married before that. Like it's like kind of a race something, I don't know why I'm doing this. But that is there. Apart from that also, I used to take pictures... a lot out of pictures, because I want to show her like what is happening in my life. Even now I'm doing that. But that became a habit right now, I couldn't stop. What happened was my last 6-7 years it's full of... like full about her only, right? I don't know a life where she's not there. I don't remember the life when she's not there. So I couldn't accept that she's not there. And then I end up speaking about her a lot always. That could be a reason I feel that. And I... yeah, the comparison is the main factor I feel.

**Krishna:** So what all do you do the comparisons for? I understood about the marriage, I understood about other things. Help me understand about the photography component? Did you say that say posts and photographs you put up so that she knows that you are having a good time? Is that what you mean?

**Partha:** Yeah, that could be also one of the thing I wanted to do. But there is no point in showing her that I'm happy. Because I'm actually not happy. Like just showing off is not going to make sense. But... but like deep down I want to do that. But I'm not doing that. Apart from that... I just want to hurt her back. But nothing I would gain. But I don't know. I'm feeling sad also if I hurt her, but I want to hurt her back because I am like... I don't know, I'm suffering so much, so I wanted to hurt back so that I feel something good. But it's not going to happen. Because that person is already moved on and they are good with their life. Only I am stuck in the loop for last one year. It's been one year, but I didn't see actual progress within me. So that makes me feel very bad.

**Krishna:** Do you really feel that, Partha? Do you feel there is no progress within you?

**Partha:** I mean, not complete... I mean, how can I say this? It's like... we have some expectations, right? Like that... So that level of [progress] that's not there.

**Krishna:** What is your expectation, Partha?

**Partha:** Uh... I mean, by now I should have at least stopped talking about that person. Like that's what I expected. But some circumstances made me like not do that. It's okay. It's okay that... I couldn't do anything, right? I mean, I'm just worried about myself that I'm not putting proper efforts or like that.

**Krishna:** Partha, I don't want you to feel that way. All right? Please don't feel that it's because you are not putting in an effort. All right? I think a lot of... a lot of this right, Partha, is there is so much comparison that is going on one hand, but also at the same time... you know Partha doesn't owe himself any credit as well. He doesn't see that... one, he doesn't see that he was also a part of that dynamic or that relationship, and that *you* are a person of your own being as well, right? It's not just associated with her, right? And at the same time, even now, I do feel that there is a lot that Partha feels in terms of "I should work harder, I should do better." Right? There is no room that Partha is giving for some kind of pat on the back for himself or some kind of... you know, you've tried your best, right? And when we talk about grief or because a breakup is also a kind of grief reaction, there is no timeline that we have to follow, Partha. Right? There is no timeline. We can all... we can all see how it is that we want to go. And of course your idea is that... okay you don't... I think... is your idea that I *never* want to think about her? Is that what your expectation is?

**Partha:** I mean, I cannot not think about her. But I just want some relief from the thinking pattern like... I don't want to think about her constantly like every day, every time. I'm just tired of thinking about that person. That's what I'm saying.

**Krishna:** Yeah, yeah. And do you feel even now every day, every time you're thinking? Or now do you feel it is only limited to certain triggers? Like I know that there is a hyperlink that happens, right? How is that, Partha? I forgot to ask you about that. Like whenever you see anything you feel like you want to link it to her?

**Partha:** Yeah, I mean yesterday I was watching a movie, but at that time I was fully immersed in the movie and I didn't think anything about her like for literally three and a half hours I didn't think anything. Same happened even Sunday also. Sunday also I went to a movie and I didn't feel much there also. The only thing is during the intervals and other stuff when I see couples, no? I feel like, "Okay. Okay, I had this person, now she's not there." So like that I just miss... I just miss a person logically speaking. So it's not... it's not *that* person, I miss *somebody*. Like yeah, like that. So... yeah, that's what I want to say.

**Krishna:** Yeah. That is an important shift, Partha. The fact that you said that. It is not *her* anymore, it is the *idea*, right? It is not about this particular person, but it is the idea of having a partner. Right? That's a huge, huge difference. Right? Now it's no longer just about her. Not everything is surrounding her. Of course it's understandable that you know, you might want a partner, that you might feel that a pang of "I wish I was not alone." Did you go for the movie alone or were you with your friends?

**Partha:** Yeah, I went with friends. Like two girls and... yeah it was Sunday two girls. And yesterday I went with Abhay. So, yeah.

**Krishna:** Right, right. So a lot of it, Partha, has to do with an idea of... you know... the idea of a relationship. And I feel for Partha there is a huge difference between what the actuality was and what the idea was. Right? What is your idea of a relationship, Partha? Let me ask you that. I'm not talking about what actually happened. I'm talking about what is your idea of a relationship?

**Partha:** Yeah, I mean... there should be someone who takes you as you are. Like they don't have to force you to be in such a way they like. Like if anybody can like anybody if they are like them, right? So it's about adjusting for something and like just evolving with them and not letting them be alone. Like whatever happens you should stay together. Like that's what I expect. That's what I expect from a relationship. So... yeah. I mean, it's them right? So no matter what they did, it's them. And we can forgive them, we can accept them. But like there is a limit for everything, but still we can manage to survive right? Like that.

**Krishna:** What is your limit then, Partha?

**Partha:** I mean, I think I crossed my limit so many times I guess.

**Krishna:** So now can you...

**Partha:** Yeah, so now... it's just nothing right.

**Krishna:** *[Audio interference/pause]* Am I audible, Partha? Did I get cut off?

**Partha:** Yeah, you are audible, ma'am. You said something right?

**Krishna:** Yes, yes. So I was asking that... so part of Partha, I could see a small smile coming on Partha's face when he was like "I think I crossed all my limits." Right? And Partha, I am not talking about last year's Partha. All right? I am talking about the Partha right here in front of me. What is Partha's limits right now? It could be in a friend, it could be in a relationship, it could be in anything, Partha. I think it's so important that when we are talking about healing and other things, right? Even now while it has gotten much better, I admit, right? But even now there is still a tendency for Partha to place himself behind. He is still not the main character in his own story. Right? For Partha, everyone else... somewhere Partha is there as a... you know... like the main character's best friend or like the sidekick. But Partha is still not the main character yet. So I am talking to the Partha right here right now. What are your limits, Partha? It doesn't make you a bad person if you have limits and boundaries. It really doesn't. It could be in friend, it could be in any sort of relationship, having these is of extreme importance.

**Partha:** Yeah ma'am, frankly speaking I don't have any... like I never had any fight with anyone else except her in my life. I don't fight with anyone. Like I was very peaceful guy. Like I don't even want to hurt anyone. And limits... people used to make fun of me, mock at me and I used to take it like, "Okay, okay, that's how they are." And then let it be. If they are happy I'm okay with that. I don't even get offended easily. Because even now my friends and colleagues, they used to make fun of me. I don't take it seriously. If someone else was in my place they would have been very sad and upset about this. But I'm not. Like maybe I'm dealing with some bigger problem, that's why I'm not thinking about these things. But actually saying I don't have any limits. See, I have this particular tendency where I say that "I love everyone more than anybody can." Like that. So I have the greatest love for everyone than anybody. So that I don't have to hurt anyone right. So that's what I feel. So yeah, I never had fight with anyone else because... I don't have to fight, right? What's the point? Because anyway they are suffering already. I mean, my point of view is they are suffering already, so I should not add more suffering to their life. So I try to be as normal as possible, as sweet as possible.

**Krishna:** Even if that involves you feeling upset?

**Partha:** Yeah, sometimes. Most of the times I mean... like people will ask me some favors but I will be still... I'll be tired, but even then I'll do it. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, but sometimes I'm like I feel like I have nothing to do so it's better to do something instead of sitting simply, like that.

**Krishna:** Yeah. This is what I mean, Partha, that... And I know where it's coming from, right? It's coming from a place where you want to be of help to others and that's... Partha that is a beautiful, beautiful trait. All right? It's not something you have to feel ashamed about. And this is not me or not us turning you into a villain at all. Right? But just because you have certain boundaries or if you tell that you are not okay with something, it doesn't make you a bad person at all, Partha. It really doesn't make you a bad person at all. Right? In that if you feel that you're constantly being say made fun of, right? Yes, sometimes we can tell that it's a joke. But sometimes if it hurts us, it is okay for us to tell the other person that it hurt us. It's okay for us to tell the other person, right? Suppose you and I are friends. All right, now you said something in a very joking way. All right, but that hurt me. Right? But now Partha's a very good friend of mine and there's a part of me that also knows that Partha probably didn't mean it, but I also can't deny that I felt hurt. Right? So I can communicate exactly that. I can tell Partha that, "Hey Partha you're a good friend of mine and I know you probably didn't intend it for that way... you really didn't intend it for that way, but I felt a little hurt when you said that. I know that was not your intention but I just wanted to let you know that I felt a little hurt." So what is Partha hearing? Partha's hearing that I felt hurt, but Partha also knows that I get it that you were joking but maybe I'm not okay with such jokes all around. That doesn't make me a bad person at all. In fact, Partha, that makes our friendship even stronger. Right? Because at the end of anything, right Partha, and when I mean a relationship I'm even talking about a friendship over here. Right? A lot of it is based on honesty. Right? A lot of it is based on vulnerability. A lot of it is based on how much I'm able to open up to the other person. Right? And what I am doing is opening up by telling that "Hey, you hurt me." And Partha that is so important to any relationship. And why that becomes important is because it helps the other person understand that yes, in a relationship we might get hurt but it's still okay for us to go on. As opposed to constantly keeping everything to myself and then allowing it to fester and fester and fester. Right? Do you get what I'm trying to say?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah.

**Krishna:** So, if I could again ask... have you thought about your boundaries as such?

**Partha:** Uh... I mean, I haven't thought about it. Maybe I should think about it, I guess.

**Krishna:** Shall we do one small activity, Partha? You can do this as... as a sort of homework. All right?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** What I will do, Partha, is... maybe in about an hour's time, I will share a worksheet with you in the chat box. Okay? It's going to be a Word doc. You can just add to it. Right? Because I know that when I'm looking down... you know when I'm looking at you in the session it's going to be hard for you to come up with certain ideas. All right? But can you... and it's a worksheet that just helps us differentiate between these. See Partha, when it comes to certain things, there are some things that you can be perfectly fine with and there are some things that you are not okay with as well. Right? You are not a very inflexible person. None of us are. Right? So all this worksheet will help you understand is... go through... go through, you know, you can do it with friendship, you can do it with relationship, you can do it with anything. All right? And Partha this does not mean you have to immediately go confront them about it. It is not for that. This is more for you to understand *you* as a person. And again, Partha, these can be flexible. All right? Something that you were not okay with two years back, you know, you may be okay with it now. And something that you were okay with two years back, you may not be okay with it now. So you get it? It's very flexible. Right? It is not set in stone. But at the same time it is so, so important for us to be aware of what are certain things right now I am okay with, what are certain things right now I am not okay with. Because even for you, Partha, that one of... one of the reasons why it's getting so hard to move on is you're still very much attached to your identity only when you were with her. We are still not able to carve out who Partha is as a person. Because once that identity becomes strong, it's so much for you to fall back on. Right?

**Partha:** Yeah ma'am.

**Krishna:** Does that sound okay?

**Partha:** Yeah yeah, fine.

**Krishna:** Yeah? So what I will do, Partha, is because I have one session now, maybe at 12 o'clock I'll attach it for you in the chat box. And then you can do that worksheet and in our next session let's start by addressing a little bit of that worksheet and then get on to... just keep a note of the triggers as well. But do you feel next week we can meet, Partha? Because it's been some time. Next week again can we meet?

**Partha:** Yeah, ma'am.

**Krishna:** Yeah? What time would suit you, Partha?

**Partha:** Next week is Monday or Tuesday... 10 or 10:30.

**Krishna:** Yeah. How about Tuesday, 23rd?

**Partha:** Yeah ma'am. 23rd?

**Krishna:** 23rd.

**Partha:** Okay, okay. Fine, fine. I think I will be no, no issues.

**Krishna:** Okay. Is there any other day that you would...

**Partha:** No, no. Any day is fine. Any day is fine. I'll be free only.

**Krishna:** Okay. So how about 23rd then?

**Partha:** Yeah ma'am. 23rd is fine.

**Krishna:** 23rd, 10:30 to 11 works?

**Partha:** Yeah ma'am.

**Krishna:** Okay. I'll share that with you right away. [Typing/Checking dates] 23rd... Just a moment, Partha. I don't think I can hear you. [Audio glitches] Hello?

**Partha:** Yeah. Can you hear me now?

**Krishna:** Yes, yes. Now I can hear you, Partha. Good morning.

**Partha:** Good morning, ma'am.

**Krishna:** How are you doing, Partha? It's been one week, right? We met last exactly last Tuesday, I think.

**Partha:** Yes ma'am.

**Krishna:** Yes. How... Yes, catch me up to speed.

**Partha:** Yeah, I am okay I guess. And I don't remember much of things that happened last week. Like I was focused on the work and yeah, nothing much.

**Krishna:** You focused on your work?

**Partha:** Work, work. Like I have some work to do but it's very tough to do so we are just focused on that.

**Krishna:** Got it, got it. Right, right. And is this usually end of the year is light, isn't it? But you have a lot of work towards the end of the year? Or is it only for US-based corporates that it's holidays? Do you have holidays and other things?

**Partha:** I mean, I do have six days leave I can take. But my manager is not approving it.

**Krishna:** Oh no, what happened?

**Partha:** Like... what happens is the work is given to someone else and that person gave the code to me to integrate, like to add it to the existing code. But I ended up taking the task and then I was doing it. And it's very tough to do and nobody else knows how to do. Like nobody in my company knows how to do. Like we need some expert who can help us. So like that... so yeah. What is happening is since nobody is knowing, we are trying and doing something and it's like more like a trial and error method but still we can't find a solution. But we cannot move further without that particular task to be done.

**Krishna:** Right. Got it, got it. Okay, all right. So is it too much work or is it like the right amount of stimulation that you need or how is it?

**Partha:** It's okay that I have this work but like I had planned that I'll take leave from tomorrow onwards. Like I told him that I'll be taking leave. He also told okay for that. But now that it's... like other people, like other coworkers are like "you can take leave, nothing will happen," like they are saying that, my seniors and all. But still I don't want to... like I told that I'll come for this week and then I'll take leave, I told my manager. So... it's okay only. It's not any big thing.

**Krishna:** Okay. But it's not causing you too much stress or you're able to manage it, isn't it?

**Partha:** Yeah. Anyway stress is there. So this stress is better than the other stress.

**Krishna:** Hmm. How is the other stress?

**Partha:** Other stress is... sometimes it's coming, sometimes it's not there. Like I think I got used to it. So...

**Krishna:** But how has this week been in terms of the recurrent thought process or any other moment in which you felt it was a major trigger that you were not able to [handle] or were you able to navigate through some of these, Partha? How has this week been?

**Partha:** Yeah, we had a team outing actually on Saturday. So there we... like we went to some resort and we were doing some activities like that... I don't know the name, I forgot the name actually. Some adventure activities.

**Krishna:** Team building activities?

**Partha:** Yeah, team building something and also that like walking, mountain climbing something, all those things stuff will be there, no? Kind of those stuff. So what happened was... those stuff I have done with her when we went out to Yercaud. Like that time I was doing... so that is my first memory of that particular adventure games. So like that could be one trigger and that I felt... I kept saying people like "Okay, I went with her for the first time," like that. So that was something. But people were like "Don't think about that. You concentrate here and you just have to overwrite the memory with this memory," and then like that they were saying. And then okay, I was fine. After that... yeah, after that it's Sunday and next two days like it was mostly about work. So there is nothing much trigger triggering things happened.

**Krishna:** And how did you get over that bit, Partha, when you were there? Was it very triggering that you were not able to do anything? Or do you feel like of course memory is going to be there? Or were you able to navigate through that? How was that for you?

**Partha:** I can come out of it. Like I was like, "Okay, it's okay, it happened." So now we can't do anything. I just make myself like... it's okay, just move on, like I was just telling myself to come out of it.

**Krishna:** Okay. How did that feel? That's great, isn't it Partha?

**Partha:** Yes ma'am. The problem is this particular state is there, no? The state where I feel okay. That state does not stay. So it will go away. That's what I'm scared of. So if next time it happens, if I couldn't do... if I couldn't do something... like I haven't went to home this week, right? So if I... this week I didn't go home. If I go home again something might come up. So I'm just scared of that.

**Krishna:** Okay. By any chance, Partha, were you able to go through that... you know that worksheet that we discussed about last week?

**Partha:** Ma'am no ma'am. I didn't even see that worksheet ma'am, actually. That's the problem. I forgot totally about that. I downloaded it and then I even took printout also but I didn't see that.

**Krishna:** No worries. No worry about it. No worry about it. But do you remember what we spoke about last time, right? That certain things that you are perfectly okay with, certain things that you are not okay with. That's the main thing about that worksheet. But were you able to think about it even when you were taking a print out and other things? Like I said... why... one of my concerns if that's the right word to use... one of my concerns is that Partha always tends to sideline himself, right? And only focus on be it friends, be it even in future relationships or anything. It shouldn't come at the cost of you engaging or doing certain things that you are not okay with because you feel like you have to do it. Right?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** So it's only from that perspective that I was wondering, Partha.

**Partha:** Yeah. Like, if I'm not okay with in the sense... I'm basically not okay with anything. That's what I feel. Like...

**Krishna:** Okay...

**Partha:** Yeah, so that sad part of me is like "what is the point of doing anything? Why do you have to do these things?" Like even right now my work is not... that is not mine, someone else's work I got trapped in. So I feel like okay why did I come in this? Like that I'm thinking. But yeah... I don't want to blame him, I don't want to tell that it's his work. Because anyway we have to do at the end of the day. So I was like, okay. I am... I somewhere between like last five years I lost what I... what I wanted to be okay with and what I wanted to be like not okay with. I forgot all those things.

**Krishna:** Why do you think that happened, Partha? That what you're okay with, what you're not okay with? Again that's so much to do with a core part of your identity, isn't it?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** Not... maybe identity is a wrong word to use but what I mean is a core part of what... who you are as a person.
