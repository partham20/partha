[00:01:03] **Partha:** Hello.
[00:38:23] **(Sound of notification)**
[00:45:00] **Krishna:** Hello?
[00:46:05] **Partha:** Hello.
[00:49:50] **Krishna:** Hi Partha, good morning.
[00:50:850] **Partha:** Good morning, ma'am.
[00:52:500] **Krishna:** Am I audible?
[00:53:570] **Partha:** Yeah, you are audible.
[00:57:430] **Krishna:** Alright. Is my audio and video both clear, Partha?
[01:00:590] **Partha:** Yeah, ma'am. It's clear.
[01:05:850] **Krishna:** Hi Partha, a long time. How are you doing?
[01:09:880] **Partha:** I don't know exactly. The thing is, for the last two weeks, I'm having more and more uh, thoughts. So, yeah. I mean, it's like, uh… it relapsed. So… Yeah, I mean, uh, I have, even though I have some work, but still I'm having some thoughts. So, I don't know, I couldn't… I couldn't use the any… whatever I have learned from the therapy, I couldn't apply it properly. And, uh… uh, yeah, I mean, for the last one week, I'm going to gym and like, and also I'm playing some cricket and carrom, all those stuff. But still, when I go home, I feel alone and I feel… I just start thinking about, uh, like, why, why, uh, like from the starting again it starts like, she's going to marry someone else. Like, the same thing is again and again is coming and it's torturing me like anything. I know I have been out of this for a while. I was like, I understood something and then I came out of it. But again, I don't know what happened. Suddenly, I'm, I'm, I'm like back to stage one. So, that that is really scary and hurting.
[02:57:330] **Krishna:** Do you feel it as intense as it was when you and I first started our sessions, Partha? I understand that there is a repetition that is happening now, but if I may ask you about the intensity of it, is it as intense as it was at the time?
[03:14:480] **Partha:** Yeah, I would say it is as intense. Sometimes I'll say it's even more than that. I don't know exactly. I don't recall what… how it was before. But now it feels like it's more intense. And like, I have this issue, that is, like if I know when she is getting married, that particular day I'll be more sad. If I don't know when, when she will get married, I would be like, I will be like always sad, right? So either way, like I don't know why I'm thinking about all these things. But still, the intensity is more. Uh, yeah, sometimes I think like, uh, I mean, this time all the things are mingled at the same time and it's torturing me like, like this. I didn't expect this to be like this because I thought I came out of that and then I was like okay. But suddenly, this same issue like everything it's starting from the first.
[04:30:460] **Krishna:** When did all this start, Partha?
[04:34:020] **Partha:** Mmm… 27, 26. Like October 27, 28, something, some date like at that time.
[04:47:110] **Krishna:** End of October, around that time was when it started, is it?
[04:51:240] **Partha:** Yeah, ma'am.
[04:56:060] **Krishna:** If we may think back Partha, can we think what are some triggers that you possibly think, you know, anything to do with dates, anything to do with months, anything to do with… Did you have a conversation with someone? I know that some of these are also trigger points for you.
[05:13:580] **Partha:** Yeah, yeah, actually, there was a marriage of someone, uh, like a common friend, common friend's relative's, uh, like brother's wedding. My parents also told that they wanted to go. I was scared that what if she might come there. So the… so I asked my friend, uh, I asked my friend whether if she is coming or not, like. And then she, he said that she is not coming. And then I was relieved. But from that, from that time, like I started thinking more about that things.
[05:57:670] **Partha:** And what is happening is, like, even if I start my bike, even if I do any normal, normal things, I, my mind is taking that to and thinking about like okay we were, uh, whatever happened with her, you know, like we went out, like the same thing again and again is coming to my mind. I don't want it to come, but still it is coming to my mind. And that, uh, like what, what is happening is, uh, that particular time is there, no? Like when I, when I went to Chennai, like when I was in college, it feels like that is a good, good time, but actually it's not. But since I'm seeing it from a lens, lens like it is good, it seems good, and I feel like I lost the, I lost that time. Like, uh, it will never happen again, like, uh, so like it, it makes as if I lost something very important. But logically speaking, it is not. Like it is not worth thinking about. But still, uh, sudden thought, sudden like, even small things, it's triggering me now more than before. Before it was not like that.
[07:18:610] **Krishna:** So by small things, you mean things like the bike and other other aspects? Is that what you meant, Partha? Is there, is there something else that you meant by these small things?
[07:27:850] **Partha:** Yeah, I mean, any, anything. Like even if I have to start my bike, then I'll think like okay, usually I used to kick start the bike of that one girl, like whenever we go out to Chennai, I'll use the bike of that girl. So that bike I'll think about that and then… I'm just linking, linking constantly. Like that is the only issue I face now. If I, if I… I just filter out the good things and then I'm just, uh, not thinking about the… like I'm just thinking, I'm just comparing my life with that, that girl and like she's going to get married soon, so I have to get married, like all those, all those things I'm doing that I don't want to do.
[08:32:000] **Krishna:** What purpose do you feel the sadness is serving you, Partha?
[08:34:520] **Krishna:** Apart from that…
[08:38:640] **Partha:** I don't know. I mean, I like again I'm I feeling alone or not I don't know, but I am, I'm trying to talk to people, like whoever, like whoever is available, I'm talking to them. But there is, I know that there is no point. It's like I am, uh, I am forcing myself to talk to them. I don't want to talk to anyone, but uh, I'm just thinking like if I can talk to someone, I'll be happy. Like, I'll be okay. Uh, that, that particular thought is there. But whenever I'm alone, uh, I feel, I feel, uh, like what is happening? It's kind of messed up. I don't know. It's like a fog. Uh, it's like a brain fog where, uh, no matter how sunny it is, it is always feels like uh, gloomy and uh, uh, it is like whatever is happening, it's not happening, like I don't feel like it's a real or alive. Like, that, like everything is coming in the same time. So I, I, I don't know how to tell it properly.
[09:57:380] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[09:59:650] **Krishna:** No, I understand what you're, what you're saying, Partha.
[10:03:080] **Krishna:** Um, no, I, I completely understand why you feel scared and why you feel anxious, right? Because for so many months you knew that you were improving, it was going well, and all of a sudden the triggers started a little bit. Is, isn't it? And I completely understand, Partha, that it can be quite scary. Yeah? But if you're thinking about healing, right, Partha? When we're talking about the journey of healing, healing does not mean that this will never happen again, but what healing means is even if this happens, I know that previously I was able to get through it and it is me getting through it even, even now. Alright? For for example, now when we take sessions or anything, it's not about promising that we'll never feel ever anxious again, because if you're a human, you will feel anxious and sometimes an anxiety might become very, very high. I understand. Right? But it is about we know that previously also, we've had high levels of anxiety. So even though I feel the same right now, I know I have it in me to get through this. That is what healing means here, Partha. Alright? There could be a couple of reasons why this is happening. Alright? One is, like you mentioned, there is a trigger and once that chain of thoughts start, right Partha, it sometimes jumps from one thought to the other thought to the other thought. Alright? So please don't… for us to feel extremely scared about it, Partha. Alright? I'm sure you would have heard of this, right? Sometimes there are lapses, sometimes there are relapses. Alright? But if I may also ask you, Partha, is there anything else that you are stressed about right now? How is your stress levels, not with respect to these thoughts coming, but in general as well, what, how, how would you rate your stress level as?
[12:00:870] **Partha:** Uh, I mean, I don't know, like I have this watch. It always says, says as high stress, constantly high stress. I don't know like if it's true or not, but I just feel like constantly I'm under stress. Like it's like someone is pushing onto you, like always. Even though I don't have anything to worry about, I'm just stressed. Like, I'm okay with the work, nothing is stressful, but uh, yeah, I mean there should be at least little stress so that you can do some work. That is there. Other than that, uh, yeah, there is no, no, no external stress, but I feel as if I'm stressed always.
[12:59:600] **Krishna:** Do you know what that stress is leading to or where it's coming from? Because if it's not work, what do you feel you are pushing yourself too hard or anything along those, those lines, Partha?
[13:14:480] **Partha:** Uh… It's not work then… Yeah, even, even small, small things, okay. I couldn't tolerate going in a, going in a public transportation. Like people talking, traffic, like even, even very small things that are very natural and which are, which I used to, used to be okay with it. Now I'm getting stressed of that. I can't, I can't stay. I mean, I am very tired. I just want to sleep always. Even though I slept for 10 to 11 hours, I will still feel like I'm sleepy. If I do, if I start doing some work, I feel sleepy. I, I, I am like, I just want to go to bed. Like that constant, constant need to go to bed is always there. And then, uh… I mean, in the free time, there is nothing to do for me. Uh, I, I feel like, uh, I mean, I couldn't do anything at the same time, if I do anything also, I don't feel, uh, that reward, like that satisfaction that I have done something good. For example, even doing meditation or any mindfulness activities, right? Or, uh, going out in any… like see, we should be happy when we go out, right? That is the main reason we are going out, meeting friends and… But even that is giving me some sort of stress. I have to go, I have to go. So, like that. Like, uh… like, how to say, even getting up, brushing, like everything seems like a big task to me and even those things, I just want to lie in bed forever. Like, like that I'm thinking. But there is nothing going to work out. So, yeah, like all those things making my regular life stressful.
[15:41:510] **Krishna:** Do you feel tired quite a lot, Partha? Even when you wake up in the morning, do you feel like I just… I don't feel like I slept? Do you feel tired throughout the day or does it fluctuate?
[15:52:010] **Partha:** Throughout the day. Throughout the day I feel tired. Yeah, throughout the day. There's not a single place or time where I feel like awake. For example, if I, if I stay in sun, like bright sun, then I feel like, okay, uh, okay, something is there, like I might feel awake, little awake. Other than that, uh, I'm just feeling sleepy always. I even stopped that, uh, sleeping pill, uh, long back, but still I'm feeling very sleepy. I don't know.
[16:33:550] **Krishna:** How is your sleep, Partha? How, how is the quality of your sleep, quantity as well both? Are you able to get some sleep?
[16:42:320] **Partha:** Yeah, I mean, uh, I rely on this watch again. So, this guy says that for the last one week, the sleep quality is really good because of the, because of the activity I'm doing, like a gym and cricket and all. So that is, that is one of the reason, uh, it shows good, good quality sleep. But otherwise, even though if I sleep for 10 to 12 hours, it says like, uh, restfulness will be in red color. It will be very less. You don't have proper restfulness and, uh, sleep latency also, it will be somewhat, uh, less. Like I am having, uh, less deep sleep and REM sleep. Like that's what it says. And then I'm also having so many, uh, like nightmares, I would say, like it's a nightmare, uh, related to anything or related to her. Even today morning I had a dream about that, that person. I don't, I don't know, like, I don't know why I'm getting these dreams and I couldn't differentiate between reality and that, okay, it actually happened yesterday. She called me and told all those things like that I'm thinking. But it's not actually happened. So, yeah, that is there.
[18:13:080] **Krishna:** What purpose do you feel the sadness is serving you, Partha?
[18:17:800] **Partha:** I don't feel anything like…
[18:24:970] **Krishna:** It's serving some kind of purpose, is isn't it? We wouldn't feel or at least Partha wouldn't feel the need to say that even if there is nothing to feel sad about, I'm looking for things to feel sad about. Right? But let's not, you know, look at it from a defensive angle. Let's just be curious about it. There's a huge difference between I wonder why is it that I, you know, what purpose is this serving me as opposed to I shouldn't feel this way. So let's change that narrative a little bit. What, what purpose do you think? Why is it that Partha feels that he is constantly looking for some things to make him feel sad?
[20:58:340] **Partha:** I mean, it is not a new thing, uh, because it is from… Yeah, it is from the start of the, like that OCD patterns like, uh, songs and with amount of thoughts. So from that time onwards, my mind will think that how can you be, how can you be happy? Like you will be like you should be sad. But there is, I don't think there is any purpose to that. Uh, but something wants me, wants me to be sad always. Like there's no actual purpose. Uh, like, but I, like, see, recently, I mean, in the last three, four years only, I realized that life is suffering, like everybody is sad. These and all is the meaning I gave it, I gave it. I just want to rationalize what I'm going through. So I think I've done all these things, like saying that life is a sorrow, everybody is sad, whatever we do is not meaningful, like all the things I, I invented or something like that so that I can rationalize what I'm going through. But that is not the reality, right? So there is no actual purpose because I, like, I don't have to be sad, but I'm sad.
[22:28:600] **Krishna:** How is the sadness helping you?
[22:33:100] **Partha:** Uh… Yeah, like the, as, as we thought, as we spoke before, uh, it, it might be saying that if you are sad now, you don't have to be sad again. Like when… it's like, it's like someone is beating you every day, if he gives a gap and if he comes back, we will be, we will be, we won't be happy doing the gap, right? We'll be thinking about when will he come back, when will he come back and beat us again. So that's what, uh, that's what I think is the single, single point where it's like, okay, anyway, we will be sad. Like what is, uh, anyway, any way, it's, it's like, it's like my entire life is dependent on that one single person and now that they left, uh, like I, I lost everything in my life. Like I, I, my life is meaningless. That is how I think. Like it's like, see before and all I used to think like I, I used to, I wanted to go to IISC, uh, to study physics. But I couldn't do that. So what happens is, uh, whenever I see something about exam or something, if I don't, didn't do well, I think like, I didn't do that one only, that is the goal of my life. Now, now what is this? This is nothing. Like that. So, similar, similar analogy will come here like, if something is happening, I feel like okay, she, she itself went. Then what is the, uh, logic of this? Like why should I need this? Why should I need anything? Why should I go pursue a degree and what, what is the purpose of my life? Like that person is left, like the entire meaning is taken from my life, like that I'm thinking. So, so even that will make me sad, right? Uh, since you believed that that person is everything, that person will help you, will save you, blah, blah, blah, all those stuff. Now that they are not there, even small things will make like, okay, your life has no meaning now, now that she gone, you don't have any meaning to, uh, like, what is the purpose? Why should you do any of the things? She's gone. Like, I know she's gone. She… part of my, part of my mind understands that this is nothing. But the other part is not understanding anything. That's the problem. Like that guy is coming and telling again and again, uh, she left, you can't, like all these years, like all the memories, whatever you had, it's know, it's meaningless. So, oh, like you did all these things and she left. What is the purpose? Like, uh, I'm just, I am just idealizing this relationship so much than it actually, it is. Everybody is happy except me that she left, but I over-idealized it and then thinking that okay, this person is everything. But it's actually not. I can see that, but I couldn't understand that.
[25:51:770] **Krishna:** This is…
[25:57:070] **Krishna:** What are you feeling right now as you're telling me this, Partha?
[26:01:970] **Partha:** Mmm… I feel two things. That is, uh, why am I repeating the same thing every time? That is one thing. Number two is, uh, uh, yeah, number two is, I will feel better whenever, whenever we have a session and then that particular day will be smooth. Like, I'll be like, okay, yeah, I can come out of this. Okay, I have support, like that I think. But after that day, like the, the that motivation or that confidence gradually reduces and come to zero. Again, I'll wait for next session and then it will be like this. It will be like a sine wave. I will just wait for the day and then and then it will go down like that. This is what two things I, I felt now. The main thing is I feel like why am I repeating the same thing again and again. That is the thing I always think during, during the, during whenever I say some things.
[27:23:710] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[27:25:750] **Krishna:** Still, it seems like she's making a way into your conversations, isn't it?
[27:31:370] **Partha:** Yeah. Yeah, ma'am.
[27:33:910] **Partha:** No, I what, like some, either somebody is telling something or I want to tell something. I just end up saying about her, even though I try not to tell for some, some days it's working. But the other days, it's like I just… it's more like I don't have anything else to talk about except her. It's more like that. Like whatever I say, I link, if you know that I link it to her. But I don't want to link, but I'm doing it involuntarily.
[28:07:370] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[28:13:620] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm.
[28:15:300] **Krishna:** And when you observe yourself doing that hyperlinking, Partha, what is it that you do at that time?
[28:22:980] **Partha:** Uh, I try to distract or do something, uh, meaningful, like… but even if I do that, after some time, after five, six minutes, again I'll go back. Like somewhere I'll drift, drift apart and then I'll go there and then I'll end up going somewhere else. So, yeah. I mean, I couldn't bring it back again properly.
[28:56:410] **Krishna:** Got it. I understood. I understood.
[29:01:210] **Krishna:** Can we try something now, Partha? This is going to be slightly different from what, what we've been doing so far. Alright? Can you think of right now as you're sitting with me, is there any hyperlinking that is happening? Since you're telling me it happens so much, right? You said that anything can be linked with her. Right now, in this very moment, as you and I are talking, is there anything that you are seeing that is reminding her, reminding you of her, anything anything like that?
[29:30:450] **Partha:** I mean, till now it was not there. The moment you asked, I made up something and then I can tell that thing to you. I just made up it, that is that I asked her, can we go for the therapy? Like couples therapy. So that, that thing I'm thinking about that now. So, like I, I successfully linked, linked that right? So, yeah, like that. So I can link anything, but I just…
[29:59:740] **Krishna:** As you… Yeah.
[30:00:810] **Partha:** Yeah, the moment someone asks me, do you, do you link it? And then I can think something and I can make it up like that.
[30:12:350] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay, alright. So when you're talking to me right now, it's reminding you of therapy, right? Because you are in a therapy session and that's reminding you of the time that you asked her can we go for couples, couples therapy. Right? Alright. Is, is that the linking that is happening, Partha?
[30:31:390] **Partha:** Yeah, ma'am.
[30:31:850] **Krishna:** Now can you tell me what is the chain of thought that's going through your mind? I know this is slightly different, but let's, let's see. I want to see what is happening. Whatever is coming to your mind, tell it to me as it is coming.
[30:46:890] **Partha:** No, nothing. Right now, I'm, I'm blank. I'm not thinking anything.
[30:53:230] **Krishna:** Mmm.
[30:55:540] **Krishna:** Maybe you can imagine if you are not in the session.
[30:58:630] **Partha:** Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking about that teacher suddenly. I don't know why, why I talked about that guy. And then I'm thinking about my friends who told that this is really bad. I mean, uh, like you should, uh, you should have left her earlier. You have been better otherwise. Like that. And then I'm thinking about some cake shop where we spoke about this. And then… yeah. I'm thinking about some random doll. Yeah.
[31:38:720] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[31:40:480] **Krishna:** Alright, okay. So of course, there are random memories also which is coming or random thoughts also which are coming, right? So it is not that it is only to do with, I know that the ratio might be slightly different.
[31:56:580] **Partha:** Yeah, I'm getting… Yeah.
[31:58:500] **Partha:** When I see the background, even then I am having unwanted thought like, it's resembles like people having sex. So that even like that is happening.
[32:12:440] **Krishna:** Mmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay, okay, alright. Um, alright. So tell me right now, right Partha, like I said, let's try something slightly different as compared to what we've been doing. Correct? So right now, when I asked you that, is there any thoughts that is, you know, so you were just talking to me and it started with therapy for you. Where was the trigger point? Was it the therapy that you are saying that, okay, I'm sitting and talking to my therapist and the first thing that Partha told me is I'm thinking about how it took me to me suggesting that we have couples therapy, right? That you and your, your ex. Is, isn't that right? Did I get that right, Partha?
[32:52:160] **Partha:** Yeah, yeah, ma'am.
[32:54:390] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay. Alright, let's, let's just stick with that for the moment. Alright? Why do you think, Partha, that the reminding happened for you there?
[33:12:120] **Partha:** I mean, it's like a learned pattern, number one. Number two is, uh, you, like since you asked me what is anything to think about her, that, that is a trigger. It's like, okay, uh, what is there? I was, I was, I was searching for what is there. And then… And then, yeah, and then that's what, I think actually, it's mostly it's like a pattern which I am doing for a very long time, I couldn't come out of it. That, that pattern is one thing. Second one is, since you asked me specifically, I just wanted to say something that's related to the situation and then related to her. So, like that.
[33:58:520] **Krishna:** Is it a made-up situation or did this conversation actually happen between you and her?
[34:03:770] **Partha:** No.
[34:04:120] **Krishna:** And is that where you went?
[34:05:890] **Partha:** No, I actually asked her. It happened. Even if I go to a restroom and if I see a tissue paper also, even that will trigger me some, some incidents. Like somewhere we took the tissue paper and then we like all those things. Yeah, that is how it is. Suddenly I'll go, suddenly it will come and that, that will make me sad and scared. So, like that, there are multiple situations everywhere.
[34:38:390] **Krishna:** Okay. Let's take this sad and scared. Is that the same thing that happened when you thought of the tissue paper right now?
[34:45:900] **Partha:** Like if I talk about that, or if I see that?
[34:50:880] **Krishna:** No, as you said that if I see a tissue paper and it suddenly reminds me of something to do with her and that makes me feel sad and scared, right? What about that tissue paper is reminding you of, of her? Or what about the therapy that we are talking about right now is reminding you? Let's draw from there. Let's start from that point. Let's not get too carried away. I'll walk you through it. Alright? But what about it is reminding you, Partha?
[35:17:800] **Partha:** You are asking what happened, uh, with the tissue paper or something else like I don't understand.
[35:28:440] **Krishna:** No, what, what I mean is, what about the tissue paper? When you said that sometimes I can see a tissue paper and it reminds me of her, right? What about the tissue paper reminds you of her?
[35:39:150] **Partha:** Yeah, I mean, we used to take some tissue papers and then we used to do some things and we throw, like that we do. And then we use tissue paper to, like, uh, while eating, we use the tissue paper, like basically. Other than that, uh, even when we are intimate, like we might use the tissue paper for something, that, that is one of the, uh, like major thing that tortures you more. And then, uh… and then that, yeah, that's it. The three things, okay. Whatever I said you, right? So in that, the last one is the more triggering one. Other than that, uh, if I, even if I see a paper, like people are doing some, like, uh, uh, what is that? Aeroplane, like rocket and something like that. I will link it to a situation where, uh, her, uh, her classmates taught her how to do the rocket stuff. So that's how it is. That is a normal, completely normal scenario, but I will think it is bad because someone else taught her and then that guy had a crush on her. Like, like I will just somehow I link it in a very tough way.
[37:04:460] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm. Got it, got it. So the, so the tissue paper is reminding you one of the times that you guys used to eat together, that you guys used to be intimate together, that you guys used to just play around with the tissue paper, right? What… so is that the only thing and now of course, as, as you, as, as you're noticing, right, Partha, your thought is immediately going towards, towards that, right? Can we gently bring it back? Gently. It is of course natural for your thoughts to go there, right? What is there a tissue paper in front of you right now?
[37:48:470] **Partha:** Yeah.
[37:49:890] **Partha:** Nothing, I'll do. I just… I'll use it if I want to use it.
[37:55:040] **Krishna:** Mmm.
[37:56:590] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Alright. No, alright. What else is that tissue paper? So you told me everything that the tissue paper does is reminding you of, of her. Alright, understood. We are not denying it. Alright, Partha? It is. Yes, there are times that we've used a tissue paper when we were eating, when we were being intimate, when we were, you know, just having fun with it, throwing things, making it into balls and throwing it around. Alright. Okay. Done. Alright. What else does, you know, what else, you know, relate it to her as well, but what else is the tissue paper reminding you of? What else can, what else is that tissue paper used for?
[38:37:370] **Partha:** Yeah, I mean, uh…
[38:38:700] **Krishna:** How else is the tissue paper serving you?
[38:41:690] **Partha:** Serving me? Uh, like after face wash, I can use it. And then… okay. Yeah, obviously, toilet paper. And then, uh… yeah, like something to remove off my face or like nose, anything, I can use the tissue paper. And then after using a washroom, I can use the tissue paper, like to clean the wetness. Mmm, yeah. And, uh, even to eat something, we'll put that inside, in the paper, right? Like if someone brought something, we can put there in the paper and then eat.
[39:26:770] **Krishna:** Yeah, yeah, it's true, true. Yeah.
[39:31:070] **Partha:** Yeah, and there are, there are many other things that I can think about tissue paper. Like my friend, he will take some tissue paper and he'll keep it in his place so that he don't have to go to the place and bring the tissue paper every time. So he, like, like this so many things are there. But all these things, I won't take it seriously. I'll take only that thing seriously.
[39:58:810] **Krishna:** That's okay. That's alright. That's, I'll tell you why that happens, Partha. Because at that moment, right, for you, there is a slight tendency for Partha to put everything into the shadow and put only one thing on the spotlight. Remember what I keep telling you? That's what Partha does. It does not mean that other things are not there. And just because we do this, Partha, it does not mean that the other thoughts that you have with her goes away. I'm, that is not our intention also here. Our intention is just to broaden the spotlight from her to also telling myself that, hey, yes, right? So Partha did say that I've had extremely strong memories of her in which a tissue paper was involved, right? We are not denying that. But what, what I'm hearing Partha say and if I could say Partha, there was a small smile that was there on your face as you were telling me the rest of it as well. I'm sure some memory about your friend also started about him carrying tissue papers so that he does not have to go around. I could see that there was a lightness in Partha's face as he, as he spoke about that. Right? And did you notice how and and when you smile, Partha, that automatically means there was some other memory which was being triggered at that moment, when you were talking about your friend. Right? So do you understand the intention behind why we're doing it, Partha? It is not to remove something. It is not to knock it out. But to say that, yes, along with this, there are other things also that is important. Let's do the same thing with therapy as well. Alright? Yes, when you, when I did ask you and when you're talking to a therapist, when you're talking to me and you are sitting in a therapy session, it is reminding you of the fact that you told her that, you know, maybe even we should go for couples therapy. Right? Okay, let it be there. Let it be there. But what else is, does therapy remind you of? Okay, you are in therapy because, you know, it all started with her. Alright. Fine, understood. We are not denying any of it, Partha. What else when you're thinking of you sitting in a therapy session, what else is coming to your mind? Let it be there. How else is it serving you? How else is it helping you? How else, what is the main, what is the other reasons that you're taking, taking therapy as well?
[42:17:840] **Partha:** Mmm, yeah, to get myself better and then come out of the, come out of the problems and then to have a better life and then understand myself. All these things I did.
[42:35:100] **Krishna:** So do you notice, Partha? Do you, do you understand experientially what we are trying to do here right now? Are you getting a sense of, sense of that? What happens to Partha is he gets carried away with only that one thought. We are not saying don't get carried away by that thought, right? We are telling… did you see, understand how we are doing it right now? That's why I wanted us to do it right here, right now.
[43:03:090] **Partha:** Okay.
[43:06:560] **Krishna:** In that, yes, I'll, I'll go back to the tissue paper example. It could be anything, Partha. I know that there is a tendency for you to hyperlink it with absolutely anything. Alright? But observe how and I'm not denying that sometimes as your, trying to delink it, other things might also come, right? Related to her. That is okay. That is perfectly fine. You remember when we initially spoke about mindfulness and everything, what did we say? That, yes, sometimes a thought might come, it is just one of the several thoughts that you're having. All that we are doing, Partha, is from that spotlight that is there, we are making that spotlight a little more wider. Right? As opposed to it only remaining on her, we are telling that okay, tissue paper, there are things that I am associating the tissue paper and her. Fine, we are not denying it. But what else can a tissue paper remind me of? Just that one, I only asked you that, Partha. What else do you use a tissue paper for? What else does a tissue paper remind you of? That's the only thing I asked you and immediately you went off into a completely different aspect. And like I said, there were sometimes in which I could see you smiling, right? I could see that you were leaning in a little bit. That means there's clearly some other memory, there is some other brain neural pathway that is activated when you're doing it, because otherwise that, that kind of reaction would not have elicited or brought about in, in Partha.
[44:41:140] **Partha:** Okay.
[44:42:350] **Krishna:** Yeah?
[44:44:830] **Krishna:** Are you understanding what I'm, what I'm trying to say?
[44:46:820] **Partha:** Yeah, yeah, I understood.
[44:48:860] **Krishna:** Yeah. So it is just and once you do that, right, Partha, it is important that you tell yourself that, yes, see, there are so many other things which are also important to me. It's not just, it's not just this. A whole lot of other things as well which is important to me and which, which this reminds me of. We are not knocking it out, Partha. We are not removing it at all. Right? But and and once again, Partha, what I'm telling you is sometimes it is okay. Sometimes these triggers might come back. It does not mean that you are completely going back because now, unlike the first time, we have strategies that we can try. So the first thing that I'm telling you, right Partha, don't get scared. Please don't get scared when all of this comes back. In fact, it's just our body is, it's just our way of reminding ourselves that okay, I've come this far, right? I've maybe a little step back, but that also means that it's maybe the push that I need to go forward even, even more, right? Healing does not mean the complete removal, Partha. It never means the complete removal. In fact, it actually shows me how strong I am. It actually shows me how resilient I am. And what better way than that for healing, Partha? That I know that I was doing well and I know that right now it's slightly challenging for me because of a whole lot of, whole lot of reasons. Right? But healing also means that I know I'm going to be able to move forward because one, you're talking to me about it, right? Two is, did you have a consultation with Dr. Lavanya anytime soon, Partha?
[46:37:610] **Partha:** I mean, I had, uh, two weeks ago. I will be having two weeks after.
[46:46:570] **Krishna:** Two weeks, two weeks after. Do you feel there is a need for you to meet her before two weeks? How are you feeling?
[46:56:470] **Partha:** I don't think so. I mean, like, I would say, remember this thing I told you before, no? Even small things make me feel like I just want to die. Like the same thing. But that still is there. Sometimes I think like, maybe the meds are not working or something like that. Uh, I really don't know what is the progress I made so far. I couldn't, I couldn't see the guy who was there. So I couldn't say, okay, this is happening, that is happening. I'm okay now. I couldn't say that properly. So I may feel like the meds are not working sometimes, sometimes I feel like okay, I feel it's working. I don't know exactly what I'm thinking about regarding the medication part.
[47:47:640] **Krishna:** Alright. But do you, is that something that you really feel, Partha? Do you really feel that there is nothing that has changed since, you know, January, February, March around that time?
[48:02:880] **Partha:** Yeah, lot of things have changed actually. But, yeah, sometimes I feel like, okay, why do you have these suicidal thoughts again? Like, why do you feel hopeless, helpless and all? Like, when that comes, it feels like okay, nothing is, nothing is happening. It's not working like that.
[48:24:620] **Krishna:** Mmm.
[48:30:460] **Krishna:** So one thing is, Partha, of course, you have made considerable progress. Alright? And that's something that is very, very objectively seen as well. Because look at it, you wrote your, um, you know, the GRE, right? You have tried so many different, different things. So many things that you have been doing, Partha. And it is important that we credit ourselves for that. But if, if I could ask you, Partha, you said… do you feel you're having suicidal thoughts again?
[49:03:620] **Partha:** Uh, yeah, suddenly I'll be like, I just want to die. I'll be normal continuously, I'll be okay. I'll be like, okay, I just want to die. What is the purpose? I just, I just want to, uh, end, end it like that. I just think like that. What, it's always in the thinking side only, but I will, I will never do that. But that even that thought is making me sad, right? Why am I thinking about death when I have everything? When I have literally everything I asked for, but still I feel like I want to die. That, that, that, that thing is really sad and sad, right?
[49:45:000] **Krishna:** Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So, Partha, there are a lot of things for you to remain alive for because there's so much that Partha has dreamed for himself. Forget everyone else, right? There is a reason you wanted to write the GRE, there's a reason that you can wanting to do all this, all of this, Partha. Because let's face it, you are someone with a whole lot of affection and love to give. And, and that is and all and what we need to focus on is driving that towards ourselves because I think resilience, strength, these are really important traits that define you, Partha. Because as, as I'm telling you, it is not easy for anyone to go through the kind of intense thoughts that you had and prepare, write exams, give GRE, look for colleges, those kind of things. Right? And I think sometimes, Partha discredits how much effort that he is putting in in giving for, for these kind of things. That becomes very, very important.
[50:52:430] **Partha:** Okay.
[50:53:720] **Krishna:** Right? Yeah. And another thing, Partha, that you need to start, which are already doing, is engage in… you remember the mindfulness techniques that we spoke about at the beginning, right? You remember the leaves on the stream and other other components? And Partha, I do not want you to engage in it only when the thought start coming. Alright? Every day can we make it a habit, regardless of whether the thoughts are there or not there. This is regardless of, of that, right? Maybe in the morning before you go to work, let's engage in 10 minutes of some kind of mindfulness and at night as well, some sort of mindfulness based, you know, um, just trying to see if I have shared a link of sorts with, with you. Alright. I, what I will do, Partha, is I will also share a YouTube video link, alright? That is more to do with, especially before you sleep, you can listen to that. It's a kind of guided meditation of sorts. I will share it with you right away on the, on the chat. Alright? But are you taking your medications regularly, Partha?
[52:00:870] **Partha:** Yes, ma'am.
[52:02:440] **Krishna:** That you're taking, right? So Partha, don't worry. We, Dr. Lavanya, we are all there. Alright? And we'll make sure, we'll see how is it that it needs to continue. But Partha, if you do feel at any point it's increasing, please have a consultation with Dr. Lavanya as well. Alright? Because at least with the medication, she will also be able to definitely help you with the same. But today, did you understand what we did in the session, Partha? I wanted it to make, I wanted you to do it in the session, right? Not just telling you this is what to do it, but in the session, think about the tissue paper example that we, that we did.
[52:43:210] **Partha:** Yeah.
[52:45:320] **Krishna:** How does, how does that sound?
[52:48:350] **Partha:** Yeah, ma'am. Uh, that's, that's I, I understood.
[52:53:870] **Krishna:** You understood how to do it? So all, think about that spotlight, Partha. Instead of putting the spotlight only on one thing, what we're doing is disposing it, spreading it a little bit.
[53:06:220] **Krishna:** Yeah?
[53:06:840] **Partha:** Yeah.
[53:08:440] **Krishna:** Alright. So, um, just give me a few minutes, Partha. I will share a few links with you on the chat itself. Um, just trying to see when I can meet you next. Just give me a moment.
[53:37:920] **Partha:** Um, can we have two, uh, like 30-minute sessions? Instead of having a long gap, we'll have a short gap and then we'll have two 30-minute sessions.
[53:49:150] **Krishna:** Okay, you want to try that for some time, Partha?
[53:51:750] **Partha:** Yeah, yeah.
[53:54:190] **Krishna:** Okay. Uh, just give me a minute. I'm just trying to see when I can accommodate a 30-minute session. Today is Thursday, right?
[54:07:390] **Partha:** Yeah, ma'am.
[54:13:210] **Krishna:** Alright, one we can do, Partha, on 17th. That is Monday at 11:00, 11:00 to 11:30. I'm just writing this down so I can help you book the same. Does that work?
[54:23:730] **Partha:** Yeah, 11:00 to 11:30. Yeah.
[54:27:140] **Krishna:** Seven… this is 17th Monday, Partha.
[54:30:260] **Partha:** Okay, ma'am.
[54:32:040] **Krishna:** 11:00 to 11:30. So do you want to have two 30-minute sessions in a, in a week, Partha? Is that what you find more effective?
[54:42:500] **Partha:** Uh, no, in a week, no. Uh, like weekly once. Like last few things, we had two weeks, right, gap. So we can have like…
[54:53:720] **Krishna:** Okay, okay. Yeah.
[54:56:880] **Krishna:** Okay. So wait, do you want it every week or do you want, or do you want 15-minute sessions every week? How is it that you want, Partha?
[55:05:430] **Partha:** Uh, 30-minute session every week.
[55:11:030] **Krishna:** Is that something that you'd prefer?
[55:12:350] **Partha:** Yeah, ma'am.
[55:15:370] **Krishna:** Okay, alright. No, no.
[55:17:160] **Partha:** Wait a second. Wait a second.
[55:19:620] **Krishna:** Okay. Hello?

[56:25:010] **Krishna:** Is that, is that okay? That is exactly next week.
[56:28:490] **Partha:** Yeah.
[56:28:770] **Krishna:** So I'm just going to share that with you right away, just a moment. Next session. Alright. I have shared that with you, Partha.
[56:41:400] **Partha:** Yeah, ma'am.
[56:42:150] **Krishna:** So you can go ahead and book for next week. I'm also just trying to see if I can share for you for seventh... okay. Um, I am unable to give you a slot once again. So what you can do right, Partha, I have opened 17th, 11 to 11:30, that slot is also open. So can you try and book both from your end? One I have shared with you. I have shared with you for 11th.

Transcript of Therapy Session
Date: November 19, 2025
Participants:
Krishna: Therapist
Partha: Client
Partha: Yeah, actually... last week when we met... we met on Tuesday-ah? Or... like some day...
Krishna: I think I... I will tell you just a moment. We met on... uh... yeah, I think last... last Tuesday. Yes, we met on the 11th. That was last Tuesday.
Partha: Okay, ma'am. So, and then Wednesday we went to a movie, and then it was nice. I... me and Abhay went. And then, what happened was... like my school pictures... when I was in school, no? Like at the time people used to bring some pen camera. So at that time, like whatever the pictures they captured, they send... they send it now after seven years. So we were like... I was happy to see that after a long time.
Krishna: Okay. Mm-hm.
Partha: And then... and then we plan to go to some nearby hill station. So like this... coming week, this week. And then Thu... Thursday... Thursday we were planning to go to one more con... concert on that is coming on December. So we just plan... the planning things were like... engaging. And then Friday... Friday is the... Friday I have to... do the work and I... I have to go to some concert in Bengaluru. So... ma'am, one second.
(Pause)
Partha: And then Friday also... Friday I went to a concert with my friends. Initially I felt alone. And then I went... I like... I mean, the friend is only one friend and he brought his... his colleagues. And then I was... I was okay with them and we had a good time. And then I came back. The next day... and then Saturday and Sunday. Both the days I was going out... out only because... uh... like I want to meet... meet a friend. Praveen and Abhirami. Both I met them. I watched two more movies. So it was good. Like... and then on Monday, yesterday. So I have some work to do. Like... it's a pending task. It's not going to complete... uh... like in s... in soon because I have to do it. It's a very big task. So all these things... like I have so many things to think about and plan... everything. So I was not thinking about anything else. This is like one of the week I felt better. I don't know, maybe placebo effect or something, I don't know. So... yeah, that could be the reason that I felt good these... these days... like these week... this week. And... and there is no much thought... there is no much thought about that... that girl.
Krishna: Mm.
Partha: Like, yeah. And that... I kept... uh... I kept the number of times I thought about that girl... let's say 20 times if it's... it's been... around 15 to 16 times I couldn't resist... I ended up talking about her. Like four, five times I can... I can stop.
Krishna: Okay, okay. That's... that's still something, Partha, right? Even if it is four or five times, that is still a number of times in which you were able to resist yourself from talking. But if you could go back and sort of... under what conditions were you able to resist yourself from talking and what were the conditions under which you found it hard for you to resist... resist yourself from talking? But that being said, Partha, four or five times is still a good number for us to start with. All right? So let's... uh... more than you resisting, I'm just trying to see what was different about those two times?
Partha: Mm... I am... I am like... I was aware that I'm going to talk about that p... I was aware, self-aware. And then...
Krishna: O... One second. How... how is it that you were self-aware, Partha? Can we sit with that for a moment? How is it that you were aware of that?
Partha: Yeah. I mean, if we start talking about this, I know I'll end up talking about her, and then it will become a big sent... like big story. So I have to stop now. That particular idea I have before talking about that particular... thing. Like, let's say hotel. So then... when if I talk something about hotel, I know that it'll... it'll come. So I was like, "Okay, I do not talk about that. I'll... I'll be silent."
Krishna: Mm. Okay. All right, all right. Do you feel you're avoiding a lot though, Partha? Because when... hearing this now I'm just a little concerned we don't want you to avoid talking about certain topics, right?
Partha: Yeah, yeah. I... I'm not avoiding actually.
Krishna: Mm.
Partha: I mean, if I'm avoiding, I know that. I'm speak... I'm talking about the things, but when it comes to that particular point, I'm stopping it. Not the entire thing.
Krishna: And not the entire... so it's not that, "Okay, I don't ever want to talk about the hotel right now," but when it... when I know that I'm going to engage or come to a point about talking about her, that is the only time I'm not going to engage. Okay. That difference is important because we should not... it should not lead to us avoiding a whole lot of conversations because that's, you know... there are so many other ways in which you can communicate. All right. So one is you felt awareness. What... what else was different between those two times? Those four or five times you were able to stop yourself versus the other times... what made it harder for you? And...
(Audio glitches/skips)
Krishna: ...breaks...
Partha: Ma'am, your voice is breaking. What?
Krishna: How about now, Partha? Is... is this better?
Partha: Yeah, it's better, but there is a lag actually. It's okay. I can manage.
Krishna: Is there still a lag?
Partha: No, no. Now it's fine. Now it's fine.
Krishna: Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, what... what I was asking is what made it difficult for you to, you know, not talk about her? And what made it easy for you to not talk about her? One is the awareness. All right, that's great. What... what else, Partha?
Partha: Difficulty is... if I start... if I start talking about that, I couldn't stop in the middle. I have to completely say it out. Like that I feel.
Krishna: Mm.
Partha: And then... the... like I stopped asking reassurance from people like mostly. I didn't... I didn't talk anything... but I just kept saying like... everything reminds me of her... like I'm just... I was saying like that. And then... I don't remember much about that.
Krishna: Mm. That's okay. That's okay. But how do you feel about at least there were four or five times in which you were able to not talk about her? And also there's another important thing that you brought up, Partha, that you stopped asking for reassurance. Right? What do you mean by that? In what way do you feel you stopped asking for reassurance?
Partha: Yeah, actually I saw a movie, I said right? Saturday. The movie is called "The Girlfriend." Actually it's really good movie. In that movie... like she goes through a lot because of that guy. And then she breaks up with him. And then like that... blah, blah, blah stuff. That... that movie gave a huge impact... impact to me so that... like I felt like, okay. I have been through a lot. And then... even though if I don't live now also, eventually I would have left her. Like that really gave a closure. Like... which... which nobody else can gi... give that. But I... I felt that. And then after that only I feel like, okay. Whatever happens has happened. It's okay. So I will have to move on and... that movie is really good actually. So if you haven't watched, you should watch actually.
Krishna: All right. I'll... I'll write that. What is it called? "The Girlfriend"?
Partha: "The Girlfriend." Rashmika Mandanna. Yeah.
Krishna: Okay, okay. All right. Hindi movie, is it?
Partha: It's in Telugu, Tamil, every... every language I guess.
Krishna: Okay. Yeah, thank you for that recommendation, Partha. I'll definitely... I'll definitely watch it. But what about the movie really struck a chord... chord with you?
Partha: That... like I haven't done anything. Like... I'm... I'm not toxic. I didn't do anything bad. But she is telling that I am bad and then she is leaving. But I didn't do anything in the first place! Then why should I be sad? She is the one... she is the one leaving... leaving me now. And if she is happy, why can't be... I be happy? So... that... that is really a good things. Like... the many things I learned from that movie actually.
Krishna: Mm. Mm.
Partha: And like... she... she was controlling me like anything. Like... that... that is true also. She was controlling like what I should wear, like all those stuff and all. And then how should I talk, walk... everything she used to control. But... and then I realized all those th... I realized that but still I was like... I was idealizing the relationship so much, right? So... I realized that I didn't even get bare minimum properly. So... yeah.
Krishna: Yeah. You know Partha, this is the first time I think I'm hearing a little bit of anger in your voice. Do you also feel that as you were telling me this? It's a fi... one of the first times.
Partha: Maybe, ma'am. I don't know exactly. Maybe... I don't know.
Krishna: Yeah. No, but... can we... can we just stay with this for a moment, Partha? Because... what are you feeling right now as you told me that?
Partha: I mean, I... I am tensed about myself that... why... why am I not coming out of this for this long? It's been almost an year. But still I am thinking about the same thing again and again. This is one... I am tensed about myself. And then... it's like... uh... if... if I... if I had a friend and if he had same issue, I would have told him to leave her and go and be happy. Like... why can't I do that? And... yeah. Like... so many things happened but still... like every time I go there I... I end up crying and... like that particular incident of teacher is like... even for normal pe... people it will be a big thing... they will think about... they will... yeah. So that thing... it's not my fault, no? Like she... if she... if she is saying like it's your fault that you have this particular OCD and stuff, that's why thinking so much and all... then it's not my fault right? So everybody will think like that. Yeah. All these things I realized. But... after some time it may go. Like... I just want to keep hold to that particular feeling and then... come out easily.
Krishna: Mm. Mm, yeah. You... I think what you're talking about is acceptance, right? I just want to accept that this has... this has happened. But can I ask you Partha, what is your understanding of the word acceptance? When you say acceptance, what... what does that sort of really mean?
Partha: Whatever happened, we cannot change. And we just have to... live in the present and move on... like... uh... do something which your... which... which is productive and just go forward. Don't think about the things which happened already. We cannot do anything any... anyway.
Krishna: Mm. Mm. Got it, got it. Do you think acceptance and forgetting is the same, Partha?
Partha: Acceptance and forgetting... No. Forgetting is totally different because if you forget... we don't... learn something out of that. But when we accept, we learn something out of that I guess.
Krishna: Absolutely. It's, you know, an analogy that I like to use, right Partha? Is... um... can... can you do something for me, right? Can you keep your hand close to your face just covering it like this?
Partha: Mm.
Krishna: Yeah? What... what all can you see right now?
Partha: Only my hand.
Krishna: Only your hand. Okay. Yeah, keep it... keep it... keep it there. Keep it there. Keep it like that. Yeah? Can you bring it forward a little bit? Little bit. Just a little. Just a little. All right. What... what all can you see right now?
Partha: I can see the chairs and my earphones.
Krishna: Mm, great. Yeah. Bring it forward a little bit more. Yeah? What else can you see now?
Partha: Yeah, I can see laptop and mobile phone also.
Krishna: Mobile phone? Can you bring your hand down slowly? Mm. Yeah? What all can you see now?
Partha: I can see the screen also now. I can see some paper lying down.
Krishna: Mm. Mm. Great, great. And you can also see your hand, right?
Partha: Yeah.
Krishna: Thank you. Thank you for doing that... uh, Partha. Um... acceptance is a lot like that. Right? In... in that... it does not mean that we forget or it does not mean that that component doesn't exist. And more importantly, Partha, it does not mean that I cannot have... memory of what had happened. Right? It does not... it does not mean that at all. It does definitely does not mean that there is no memory of what is it that had happened. But... earlier... for Partha it was right here. All he could see was the relationship, all he could see was... her, all he could see was everything that happened over there. And... and almost like that is the only thing I can see, I can't see anything else. What Partha said is "I could only see my hand." Right? But now what we need to do is slowly start bringing it down, Partha, so that... yes, while the hand is still visible, you can also see other things that is happening... um... around you. Right? Other sort of things... say the laptop you were able to see, your earphones, and by that what we mean is the external world around us. Right? And... and just because we see the external world does not mean that I cannot look at my hand. I can look at my hand when I want. But also I can look back... and see that there is a whole other world that is there outside. That is what acceptance is, Partha. It is not that some of these thoughts may not come back, but it is not going to be right here where this is the only thing that I can... I can see.
Partha: Yeah.
Krishna: Right? It's a little bit of flexibility is what I'm talking about over here. That... yes, I can hold this, but I can also hold space for other components. I think, you know... this is something that I keep telling you in every... every session, right? In... in terms of flexibility that needs to be brought about. But more importantly Partha, I think... to be very honest... when you said that... you know... "I am not the toxic person. I didn't do anything wrong," right? I did notice a slight shift in your voice as well when you said it. Right? Not... you know... not extreme levels of anger or aggression because Partha is not that kind of person. You're not someone who is going to be angry and aggressive, right? That's very fundamentally different to who you are as a person. But... I felt there was so much protectiveness to what you were saying there. Right? Now as... as you're telling it or as you thinking about that... that "I didn't do anything wrong," right? I know that she is... she is the one who left in the first place. I am not toxic person even though she keeps saying that I am. As you're repeating those words, what else is coming up for you, Partha?
Partha: No, I... like I blame myself that... uh... I am the reason that I... like this happened. Some... like I would have done better. Like that I would say myself. Other than that... it's like... I'm just confused. Like... why... why this happened. Uh... she told that... like everything will be... she said right? Like I'll be forever with you... like all those stuff. Like that and all I was like... okay, a broken promise. Uh... everything... whatever... whatever... uh... we have so many favorite songs which we used to sing and all. That's... those if I can't listen to those songs, right? So I'll just overthink so much things. Uh... my school days and then... uh... the time I... I used to be... go behind her and all. So... those things and all I think and I feel like... uh... okay everything is now meaningless. Like that I'll just think. So all these things I think and then I'll get tensed. Uh... like wh... why she left. Again I'll think that same thing. And then there is no proper actual answer given to me... except that... uh... like I don't under... understand. She just found some reason to give me and then she left. That's what I feel.
Krishna: Mm. Mm. But there is also a part of Partha that feels... I have not... I have not done anything wrong. And I think you said that also. I feel like with the teacher incident... anyone would have felt that way.
Partha: Yeah.
Krishna: It's not to do with Partha. Right? What made you say that, Partha? That anyone would have... anyone would have felt that way.
Partha: Yeah, like whomever I told this situation to... people, no? They were like... "Why didn't you understand that she liked that guy? Then you should have understood that by... by that... by now. Then why are you keep asking her? And she will not tell anyway, no? Then... like she said that 'I don't know if I love you or not'... like that 'I don't know' words and some other things and all..." which was more... most triggering... even to the Claude [AI model], I was saying the entire story... like exactly in a chronological order. So you can understand better. So he told me... it's not only you, anybody would have felt that in that way. Like whomever I told this to, no? They are... they are like... "Why are you still behind this girl like... like that?" I mean... it's... I mean, if... the thing is... she... she is not accepting that she gave the gift after the marriage. I am okay with that. Like she can give after the marriage, I'm okay. Like that was a T-shirt... shirt she... she gifted him right? To... I... I was the one who gifted it. She asked me for help... to give... give the gift. I gifted it... after the marriage. It's not before the marriage. So that particular incident is what... is the main incident. If she accepted it... I would have been okay. Like okay... uh... but she is not accepting it. She... she's just saying that I gave before marriage. Which is not possible because I was the one who gave it. So that is the reason my doubts started increasing. Like... more. If she accepted it, I would have been okay. She do accepted it when I show the proof. Again after... after a month, when I ask about her she is like, "I didn't give that... that time." She is just changing it.
Krishna: I'm so sorry Partha, just a moment. Just a moment.
(Pause - Therapist interruption, possibly a call or technical issue)
Krishna: Hello? Hello?
(Pause)
Krishna: Sorry about that. Yeah. Yeah.
Partha: Yeah. So she just not accepting it whenever I ask. So that... that leads to more doubt and... like... still I'm saying no... if it's... if it's a guy or some neighbor or relative, I would be okay with that. Since it's a teacher... that is the thing that is so much traumatizing me. So I don't know.
Krishna: Mm. Mm. Mm. Got it, got it. Right, right. I... I think... do you still keep thinking about that incident Partha? Or do you feel that it's not... you don't think about it as much as you used to? What are some triggers for you right now from the teacher relate... that incident?
Partha: Yeah, when we see a teacher... or "Sir"... or... like... yeah... a school bus or some teachers will see, no? That people... and... uh... yeah... that... that particular year, 2017, 2018. Some songs... like the songs which he sent to her. So that particular song if I listen, no? I... I'll become somewhat scared. I don't know why. But to... to avoid that... scarness I just watch the song again and again. Just to avoid that... to control myself from getting scared. I was like, "Okay, whatever it is I'll face it." Like that I'll try. And then... yeah, nowadays it's reduced comparatively because before and all it... it used to be a lot. Now I am like... okay. It's over. Like what can I do anyway? It's over like that. So I'm not thinking about that too much.
Krishna: Mm. Mm. Mm. Okay. Okay. All right. But still when you think about teacher and other things, does that present as a very strong trigger for you Partha? And do you feel you engage in some kind of constant... is it that moment that you feel like you need reassurance? Is it that moment that when that thought crosses your mind is that the time you reach out to a friend or you talk to someone about it or immediately you distract yourself? Is... is that the time that happens?
Partha: Sometimes I say to people like... uh... this is what happened... like like that. Sometime I say to people, I won't ask reassurance. I just want to say what I'm thinking. Second time... I... second thing is that... uh... yeah... if I feel scared... I will do something. That is like... listen to the song. And... like I should not be scared and skip the song, right? I just want to listen to the song and then I'll wait and listen... and then... and then I'll do it. Like that. So those are the things. Other than that... there is nothing much. I feel sad for some time anyway. And then it will go away. I'm not doing anything for that to... go away. It will go away eventually.
Krishna: Mm. Mm. Okay. All right. But these are still some triggers that you feel, Partha? Do you... do you try to avoid some of these at times? Is there anything that you are avoiding right now that you feel? Even if it is a little bit.
Partha: Yeah, yeah. I am avoiding so many... so many songs and then... uh... like marriage... marriage things and then... anything related to couples. And then... um... what else is there? Yeah... like I... I haven't went to my hometown, right? Last week. So that can be a reason I am not thinking too much. If I go to my home... there might be more trigger than... uh... me being here. So... I don't know what will happen if I go this week.
Krishna: Are you planning to go this week Partha?
Partha: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm planning to go this week.
Krishna: Mm. Mm. Hometown is always a bit of a trigger point for you, isn't it?
Partha: Mm. I mean, even now I'm... I'm connecting everything to her. But the intensity is not that much. I mean I'm still connecting, but the...
Krishna: The intensity is...
Partha: Yeah.
Krishna: Mm. Maybe the reason the last... yeah.
Partha: Yeah. I mean... I... I should not think that... uh... like maybe it's a... I'm... my mind thinking that okay... I've taken a extra dosage so I... I will feel happy... I will feel better... like that I may think, no? Medicine I'm talking. So... yeah. That could be a reason. Other than that... that movie could be a reason. Second reason that I'm feeling less in... intensity. Other than that... yeah that's it. And then these plans and all coming right? Like this week, next week I'm planning to go somewhere. So these and all is in my mind. And then I'm just occupied. So I'm currently occupied. So that could be a reason for me not being so inten... intensely thinking about that. So... yeah.
Krishna: Mm. Okay. All right. How do you feel Partha at the pace that you and I are at... at the moment... that we actually confront some of these things that you've been avoiding? I know that we've been keeping it apart for a... for a bit, right? Say some of the songs and other... other things. All right. How about... we actually sit with it now. As opposed to you sitting it... sitting with it by yourself. For us to try it in... in the session itself. Right? And... does... does that sound okay Partha?
Partha: Yeah ma'am. We'll try that.
Krishna: But can you help me understand that when you think about the teacher... any teacher Partha, when I say the word teacher itself, does it create some kind of difficulty in... in you?
Partha: Yeah. Yeah.
Krishna: How much difficulty does that create? Percentage wise.
Partha: 75 percentage.
Krishna: 75 percentage? You said that there are some songs that you're avoiding. How much... if you were to listen to those songs, how much... again, distress is it creating?
Partha: 90 percentage.
Krishna: 90 percentage? All right. Marriage related aspects Partha? Anything to do with marriage?
Partha: Yeah, it's still 90 percentage.
Krishna: 90 percentage. And how about couple related aspects?
Partha: 80 percentage.
Krishna: Those is 80... 80 percentage. Anything else that you feel you've been avoiding any other triggers, anything that is causing you distress?
Partha: No ma'am. If it's there I'll let you know. And like if you have the... uh... similar thing which we done before, no?
Krishna: Yeah. Yeah. I... I still have... in that... you also spoke about... um... and that's why I'm... I'm talking about it because I also know you spoke about... even your childhood.
Partha: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that... that is one of the major issue. Like my entire childhood feels like it's gone. Like that.
Krishna: Say some... for... how much distress if you were to go back to your childhood or looking at photos of your childhood... does that cause for you Partha?
Partha: Yeah that is... like maximum 100 percent.
Krishna: That is 100 percent?
Partha: Yeah.
Krishna: Okay. Okay. All right. Um... no I... I still have the list that you have made. We can go through that once... once more. All right? Um... but how about in our next session we start with one of this Partha? Provided nothing else sort of happens. All right? Shall we start with one of these? I'm just giving you a heads up so you have an idea what... what we will be doing in our next session. Does that sound okay?
Partha: Sure ma'am. We'll do that.
Krishna: Can we have a session next Thursday Partha?
Partha: Next Thursday... yeah... yeah ma'am. We can.
Krishna: 27th. What time will work for you? Say... um... the same time or 10 to 10:30 or 11 to 11:30? What would work?
Partha: 10 to 10:30 is also fine.
Krishna: 10 to 10:30 works?
Partha: Yeah.
Krishna: All right. So I'll just share that with you right away. Just give me a moment. Um... 10... 10 works, right?
Partha: Yeah.
Krishna: Okay. So I've shared it with you Partha for next Thursday 27th 10 o'clock. Did you get it?
Partha: It's just loading ma'am. I think... I think... I will get it.
Krishna: Okay. No worries. In case you've not received it just let me... let me know. Because even my internet is a little shaky right now. Um... but I... I think for me I can see it on my dashboard that it has been sent to you. So you can just let me know how... how that goes.
Partha: Yeah ma'am. I got it.




Here is the transcript of the therapy session.
Note: The client’s (Partha) audio is significantly lower in volume and muffled compared to the therapist. Where his speech is unintelligible, it is noted in brackets.
Therapist: You reached out and said that you wanted to purchase some package, was that possible? You told them that you wanted a 30-minute package, right?
Partha: [Faint response] Yeah.
Therapist: Okay, alright, that's good, that's good. So how are you Partha? How has the last week been? Are you okay? You look a little tired, [have you] not been sleeping well?
Partha: [Faint/Muffled speaking about how he is feeling] ...tired.
Therapist: Hmm. How are you feeling though? Are you feeling tired?
Partha: [Long section of faint/muffled speech describing his mood and state]
Therapist: Hmm... hmm... Okay.
Partha: [Continues speaking faintly]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Continues speaking faintly]
Therapist: Hmm. Low mood, yeah.
Partha: [Continues speaking faintly]
Therapist: Hmm. Which medication has been increased?
Partha: Sertraline.
Therapist: Sertraline, okay. Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm... hmm... Okay. All right, yeah, that seems like you might benefit with that slight increase. Um, but when you said that she gaslighted you—I mean, your ex—what did you mean Partha? How do you feel that she gaslighted... gaslighted you? And what was the... what made you reach out to her?
Partha: [Faint speaking explaining the interaction]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm, hmm. When she told that even she is feeling hurt and upset and other things, is that what you meant Partha?
Partha: [Faint/Muffled agreement]
Therapist: Hmm, hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Right. See Partha, a part of it, when your ex also says that it was painful, right? It does not necessarily mean it’s because of you, Partha. The thing is, a breakup, when we talk about a breakup, it is definitely painful for both parties, right? But that does not mean it's because you did something or they did something, right? It is painful because, at the end of the day, for both—for you and for her—it is a loss of a relationship. It is a loss of a relationship that meant something at some point of time, even though it may not mean the same right now to—especially in your case—to one person. It is still something that meant, you know... there were good times that both of you had.
So the pain that she's talking about does not necessarily have to mean, Partha, it's because you did something, right? It's more about: this was a relationship that we had, and it's now come to an end, and that can be a painful realization for... for everyone. Although, both the parties that's involved in that relationship.
And of course, Partha, even you've been hurt. Isn't it? You also felt hurt in the relationship, you also felt hurting after the relationship came to a conclusion as well, isn't it? So it's not just about... it's not just about you.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Right? But when she says she is also feeling hurt, it... it does not necessarily mean she's pointing fingers and saying that is because of you. A lot of it is happening because, you know, breakup is the end of a relationship. And this is a relationship which had two people involved in them right from the beginning.
So don't... let's not feel the necessity to take it very deeply or very personally, so as to say, Partha. It just... it does not mean that it is because you did something wrong. But of course, you are also hurting in the process. The relationship, and the end of it especially, is something which has upset you quite... quite a bit. So please don't think, Partha, it's everything because of what you have done. Please remember, Partha, relationship, right? It has two parts. There are two people who are involved in it.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Right? But... how did you feel after you got off the call and everything with her? And what was the... apart from the day that you reached out to her, Partha, were there—I'm sure other days also—did you have memories that was coming in? How did... how were you able to deal with it? Were you able to try the technique that we... you and I experientially did in the session that... that last time? Were you able to try it? Tell me about how was that experience? And how... how was that experience for you in general?
Partha: [Faint speaking, describing his attempt at the technique]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm... hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm... hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: How was it recently that you brought her up? Can you give me an example of that? Let's be... at least let's start with being mindful about that. You... you know, a recent example in which either you or somebody that you know brought up the con... the topic conversation with... with her.
Partha: [Faint speaking, giving a specific example]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm... right. It's... it seems like there's a lot... Yeah, and then the other?
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm.
Partha: [Faint speaking]
Therapist: Hmm... hmm. Right. It seems to me like, Partha, there is a lot of reassurance seeking that you're looking for, right? So for example, when you tell someone that, you know, "Did I do something wrong?" the moment someone tells that "No, no, no, you didn't," that time it becomes okay, right? But the thing is that it... it creates a pathway wherein I feel like I need to keep hearing that over and over again. Right? So it is a very short-term gratification that you're getting because of that, right?
In that moment, I tell you that, "Hey Partha, it's fine, it's not your fault." You feel better, of course you feel better. Right? But what is... what is happening in that process, right Partha, is deep down—you keep telling me this because I know that you also know that it's true—deep down you know that you've not done anything wrong. Deep down, you know that there is... it is for the better that this relationship didn't work out, because you yourself have told me in these very specific words, right?
But what is actively... Partha knows it, but he cannot feel it. That is the main difference that's... that's happening here, right? Intellectually, Partha knows what is it that is happening, but he's not able to feel it. And... and what happens, right Partha, this constant reassurance seeking and other things, it is only feeding to that intellectual component. It is not allowing you to feel it. Because for us to feel it, we have to go through it. We have to understand that I am feeling this way... not necessarily reaching out to everyone at that point.
Right? But can I tell myself... Can I sit with it myself? And can I tell myself that... it is... it is hard. It is hard for me, but I know that this is not something that I have done which is wrong. The moment that "I" comes in, right Partha, you will notice that... that feeling that you're talking about, it's more accessible. You're easy to get hold of it a little... a little better at... at that moment. As opposed to when somebody else tells you that, "Hey, it's... it's okay."
I'll tell you another reason why that is happening, Partha. Because again, what you told me is sometimes another person might not be readily available to reassure you, right? Say it could be a friend, say it could be your mom, anyone. Sometimes when you answer the call or you want to talk with them, they may be busy, they may not be able to do it, right? Not because they don't want to, but because, you know, other things sort of get in the way sometimes. And immediately then Partha's anxiety, what happens? It doubles. It becomes even more because "I don't know how I can handle this myself."
Right? So there are two things that is happening with this reassurance seeking, Partha. Yeah? One is it is giving us a very delayed... or rather immediate gratification, right? Not delayed, immediate. I ask this, someone tells me, "Ah, okay, I am... I am fine."
Because reassurance seeking is a type of compulsion. Yeah? It is definitely a type of compulsion. Although for you, I don't know how regularly that happens. It's not every time that you engage in it. But regardless, Partha—remember when initially we started talking about it?—it is definitely a type of compulsion that... that we have.
Right? And what is it? The more I do the compulsion, I feel it is only then that whatever I'm scared about is, you know... is that's the only way it is going to get solved. But in reality, what is the case? Whether I do it or not, it is... it is not the end of the world. Nothing so terrible is something that is going to happen about it.
Right? So let's... let's try something, Partha. All right? Is it possible that for this upcoming week, you're able to just keep tabs maybe—all right, just keep a tab—on how many times do you feel the need to seek reassurance?
Partha: [Faint/Muffled speaking]
Therapist: All right? And out of that, how much were you able to not seek it and how much were you able to do it for yourself? It might be fine. We are not immediately thinking about not reaching out to anyone. Ultimately our aim is that, yeah? But it need not be an immediate... like an immediate aim of sorts. Right? It definitely genuinely does not have to be an immediate... immediate aim.
But let's start with maybe identifying... okay, what is it that I feel like? Why is it that I feel like I want to reach out to this person? And instead, can I tell... can I sit with it for myself? All right, let's say you sit with it for maybe, I'm going to wait for maybe 20-30 minutes, and even then if... if it's not working out, then I will reach out to someone and ask about this.
But also Partha, if at any point any of your friends or colleagues or anyone talk to you about it, you can always tell them, "Hey, I... I appreciate it if we don't talk about this."
Partha: [Faint agreement]
Therapist: Right? Because what you said is sometimes even other people come and ask you about... about this. Right? It is not helping us sort of move on or move... move forward Partha. It becomes a little... that becomes a little hard. Right? So let's do something that actually helps us move forward, that actually helps us not get stuck in the same patterns that we're constantly sort of seeing ourselves getting... getting stuck in.
Right? And coming back to quickly, Partha, I also know that you said, "All right, when I go to the beach, I know that I've not been to the beach with somebody else," so it becomes a little, how do I put it, slightly more harder for us to um... think of other scenarios, all right? But the moment I find my thoughts are going, gently bring it back to the here and now. Can I just maybe observe the beach then?
Right? Thoughts will be there. All right? Thoughts will be there. And that is a good time for us to just not ascribe anything [like] "All right, I remember sitting her with her on the beach," we used to come to the beach together. Now I see that my thoughts are going slightly in the direction with... with her. What does coming back look like? What color is the beach? Right? Is there foam that is coming in? Right? What color is the sand? Can I... how does the sand feel? Is it windy? Just one or two, three questions like that is enough for our mind, Partha, to come... come back to that... to come back to that sort of component.
Partha: [Faint agreement]
Therapist: Right? Can we... can we try that Partha?
Partha: [Faint agreement]
Therapist: All right. So Partha, can we meet next Wednesday, Partha?
Partha: [Faint speaking, suggesting a time] ...10:30?
Therapist: Say around um... morning? Yeah, say 9 o'clock?
Partha: [Inaudible]
Therapist: 9 or 10:30, either would work.
Partha: 10:30.
