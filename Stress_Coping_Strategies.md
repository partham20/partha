Hello, Partha. I hear you, and I can sense how heavy and overwhelming this stress feels right now. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling this way given everything you’ve been navigating—the grief, the OCD loops, and the sheer exhaustion of trying to manage your mind constantly.

Based on the journey you've shared in your files, you already have a toolkit that you've been building with Krishna and Dr. Lavanya. When the stress hits hard like this, our minds often go blank and forget what works.

Let's try to pause and use what you already know. Here is a step-by-step approach to help you navigate this current wave of stress:

### 1. Immediate Grounding (The "Emergency Brake")
Right now, your mind might be racing or hyper-linking everything to your ex or your fears. Let's interrupt that.
*   **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** You mentioned this in your sessions. Even if you can't finish it perfectly, just start.
    *   Look around. Name **5 things you see**. (e.g., "I see the laptop, the wall, a pen...")
    *   Touch **4 things**. Feel the texture.
    *   Listen for **3 sounds**.
*   **Breathe:** Take a slow, deep breath. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4. This physically signals your body to calm down.

### 2. Label the Thought (Cognitive Defusion)
Remember what Krishna taught you about the "Spotlight"? Your mind is putting the spotlight on the most painful thoughts right now.
*   Instead of saying "I am stressed" or "I will never get better," try to say:
    *   **"I am having the *thought* that I will never get better."**
    *   **"This is an OCD thought loop."**
    *   **"This is a wave of grief passing through me."**
*   This creates a tiny bit of distance. You are the person *observing* the storm, not the storm itself.

### 3. Challenge the "All-or-Nothing" Thinking
Your files mention a tendency to feel that if you have one bad day, *everything* is back to square one.
*   **Fact Check:** You have made progress. You cleared your IELTS. You’ve had days where you felt "okay." You’ve resisted the urge to call your ex before.
*   **Shift the Narrative:** This current stress is a "lapse," not a total "relapse." It’s a dip in the graph, not the not the end of the road.

### 4. Small, Low-Stakes Action
Depression and stress breed in stillness. Do one tiny thing that has nothing to do with your ex or your career.
*   **Physical Movement:** Walk around your room for 2 minutes.
*   **Sensory Change:** Splash cold water on your face. Eat something with a strong taste (like a lemon or mint).
*   **Distraction:** Watch a short video on a topic you like (science, AI, or even something funny). Not to "cure" you, but to give your brain a 5-minute break.

### 5. Connect (Even Briefly)
You mentioned that being alone often makes the loops worse.
*   If you can, sit with your mom for 10 minutes, even if you don't talk about anything deep. Just being in the presence of someone safe can lower cortisol.
*   If that feels too hard, maybe write down exactly what you are feeling in a journal (or here). Getting it out of your head and onto "paper" can stop it from bouncing around inside.

**You are resilient, Partha.** You have survived 100% of your bad days so far, including the ones where you felt completely hopeless. You are building a "New Partha," and that takes time and is incredibly hard work. Be gentle with yourself today.

*If the stress feels unsafe or unbearable right now, please reach out to your therapist, your emergency contact (your mother), or a crisis helpline immediately.*
