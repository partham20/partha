***

**Krishna:** ...and I am extremely sorry about that. Thank you so much for waiting. My most sincere apologies, I did not anticipate such a large spillover.

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah. I understand, ma’am. It’s okay. Complete okay.

**Krishna:** So how are you, Partha? Are you back home? I can see a different setting than the usual office depths that you are at.

**Partha:** Yeah, ma’am. I took long leave and then I came home.

**Krishna:** Okay. All right. So since how long have you been at home?

**Partha:** Since... since last session. Like last Tuesday. Till next Monday I’ll go actually. I told the manager is not giving me leave but I just took it.

**Krishna:** I’m happy to hear that. And how have you... is this the first time after a long time you're taking a long leave?

**Partha:** Yes, ma’am.

**Krishna:** How are you feeling about the fact that you're actually taking a leave?

**Partha:** The thing is, initially I was like... I felt bored. And then I had some works. And then I met my friends. Today also I am going to meet my friends. But the thing is... something that is blocking my happiness. Blocking in the sense... some kind of thinking that, "What is the purpose?" Like again, the routine is again going on. Like what is happening is... if I supposed to go somewhere, I should be excited, right? Somewhat. Somewhat we will be happy. But I feel like it's a burden. Like why should I go? Why should I torture people by going there and all those stuff? And then, like since the plan is not perfected—every time they keep on changing the plan—I'm like...

**Krishna:** Who are these, Partha? Your friends, is it?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah, my school friends.

**Krishna:** Okay, okay.

**Partha:** I am... I am happy when I go there and if I'm being with them, I am happy. Otherwise, if I come back and... what happens is, when I come back, and then the next day... still that time lapse. Like yesterday feels very long, that is still there. And then, yeah, other things and all is okay. Most of the thoughts are less and then I can manage. And also I have done that worksheet and then I have sent you that.

**Krishna:** Did you share it with me?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah.

**Krishna:** Okay, I don't think I received it. Did you share it on the chat?

**Partha:** Yes. It's not... Oh. I have sent it, ma’am actually. Okay, I'll send the next time, it's okay. It's not there.

**Krishna:** No worries, no worries. Because I think the last... I'm not able to... let me open it up here maybe. No Partha, unfortunately not able to see it. That's okay, maybe after this you can just share it once more with me.

**Partha:** Sure, ma’am.

**Krishna:** But you did say something now, Partha. You said that there were moments of irritation when you felt that the plan was changing?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is... irritation in the sense... like my friend wants to go to some nearby hill station around... like today is New Year's Eve, right? So at night he want to go. But my mom is like, "Don't go." Like, it's very be... be very cold and stuff like that. I cannot say no to that guy also, I can't say no to my mom also. Like I'm just stuck in between of them. And then... that's not a big deal. Anyway, even if you go, nothing will happen. I know that. But still. That is one thing. And then everybody is leaving. Like if one friend is there, one friend is not there. So like that. They are leaving and he is coming and they are leaving. So that also is making some form of stress. That's it.

**Krishna:** Leaving in what sense, Partha?

**Partha:** Leaving in the sense... one friend is leaving to college back. One friend is coming from the, like his native place. So that like... if everybody is there then it's better to meet right? So yeah, that was there. It's not a big thing but still, that is there. And like on a positive note, I feel like something is useful. Like because I ordered new computer parts to make a new PC. So that is basically one thing which makes me happy always. So that thing... today it will come. Tomorrow I'll make that mostly. So yeah. So that particular day will be good. But what happens... when I go to the regular schedule again... even day before yesterday I went out with my friends. What is happening is I tried... tried stop talking about that girl. I didn't talk much about the girl.

**Krishna:** Okay, okay.

**Partha:** I didn't talk at all actually. But at the end I spoke little I guess. Other than that, I think it's a good progress I feel like that.

**Krishna:** Yeah, definitely, definitely. And how are the triggers, Partha? Because I know you're back home for a longer duration. How is that? How have you been coping with it rather?

**Partha:** The triggers are there... What happening is, the trigger is there... Trigger is constantly there. It's not going anywhere. But when the date is over—for example yesterday is over, day before yesterday is over—but when I was in that particular date, it was there. But if I see now those days, I'm not feeling any triggers. I'm feeling only the good things. I'm feeling only the outing which I went... I don't remember the bad stuff. Maybe there could be like some nostalgic filter I'm seeing, I don't know.

**Krishna:** That's good, Partha. Right? And I think... and what I mean by that is... see, when you talk about what you went through, right? There is a lot of... I think in its own way, it's a little bit of grief, isn't it? Right? Because it is a loss. And our idea here, Partha, is not to remove it entirely, right? Because you're a human. That's what I'm trying to tell you. For you, for me, it's not about forgetting or removing that emotion in its entirety. But it's more about "de-centering" it a little bit. And that's what I'm hearing you say. That when I'm actively thinking about it, that time I feel sad. But when I'm with my friends or when I'm doing other things, I'm able to stay in the present moment. Is that what you also feel has been happening?

**Partha:** Yes, ma’am.

**Krishna:** Can you give me an example of that, Partha? So that you and I are also able to say that okay, that is exactly what you're talking about.

**Partha:** Example in the sense like... yeah, if I go today and if I end up speaking about that girl, they will be like, "It's okay, leave, nothing will happen." They will encourage me and... I will just move on. Like easily I'll get distracted. Whereas if I'm alone, it's very hard for me to get distracted. And then... yeah, that is one point. The next one is... whatever happened yesterday or day before yesterday... doesn't... it's not affecting me so much. Only the present thing is affecting me. So yeah. But the thing is I'm just worried that... like whatever happens, that particular something... something is there that is making me sad. I don't know how to explain that. But that particular "happiness blocker" as you said... that guy is always there. So like, "Why should you meet? What is the purpose?" Like constantly he is making everything meaningless. Like everything is not useful. Like that. Why do you have to do any of these things? Like why are you torturing people to meet you? Like that. I'm not torturing. I'm just talking normally. But he is just thinking like that.

**Krishna:** Got it, got it. Can you give me an example when is the last time this happened, Partha? Just a most recent example. Just so that we can track something.

**Partha:** Today. Today morning it happened. Today morning I was like... when like when these guys are coming and my other friend call me to go to hill station. I told my mom that I have to go and she's like don't go. So all those stuff happened. I was like... and then I was like, okay, what is the purpose of going anywhere? If I come back... come back to home, again I'll feel the same way. So like, why do you have to go anyway? Like that I'm thinking.

**Krishna:** Got it, got it. So this was after your mom said no need to go, right? Or even if... I'm sure that even if your mom didn't say that, this thought would have probably come for you.

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah. Sure.

**Krishna:** But there must have been some reason right, Partha, that you even contemplated going there in the first place? Right? So can you help me understand that? There must be some reason...

*[Phone rings in background]*

**Partha:** Ma’am, can you say... can you say it again? Sorry, sorry. One second, one second.

*[Partha takes a call]*
**Partha (on phone):** Bro, bro, bro. Approma call panren bro. Oru half an hour. Hello? Approma call panren. Okay. Session.

**Partha:** Yeah, ma’am. I got a call.

**Krishna:** No worries. Am I audible?

**Partha:** Yeah, ma’am. You're audible.

**Krishna:** Yes, yes. Yeah, so what I was asking you is... what was that like for you initially? What was the reason that you even contemplated going for it in the first place?

**Partha:** Like I have an idea that that place is good. Whenever I go there I'll feel good. So I want to go. I want to go to that place very long, like from last six, seven months I wanted to go. But what happened is we couldn't go. Like people won't be available so we can't go. Now my mom told that we will go like that. But what I am thinking is that... yeah, the thought that if you come back home after going anywhere, you will feel sad anyway. Then what is the purpose of going there? Like that I'm thinking. And then also this thought... this thought that... like it's like some learned helplessness. Whatever I learn, no? Like I feel like no matter what you do, nothing gonna help you. So why try? Don't try only. Like that I'm feeling.

**Krishna:** Got it, got it. So what I'm seeing is... on one hand, initially there is a thought that "I want to go there." There is some excitement and other things which is there. And immediately there is a thought that "But what's the point?" Right? What is the point if you're going to go there, come back, and then again you're going to feel bad about it? Right?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** So what is happening with Partha is again, there is so much of fixation on either of the one. Right? Either... you know... and most of the time it comes back to "but anyway that other guy" right? Is telling that what's the point of all of this. Isn't it? So what is important for us also to understand and do here, right Partha? Is sort of make space a little bit. And that's what I'm hearing you say. That "When I'm actively thinking about it, that time I feel sad. But when I'm with my friends or when I'm doing other things, I'm able to stay in the present moment." Is that what you also feel has been happening?

**Partha:** Yes, ma’am.

**Krishna:** See, I'll give you a very simple example over here. All right? Now, are you someone who likes sunsets?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** You like sunsets. Okay, great. So now suppose I go for a sunset. All right? And now I'm standing there and I'm watching the sunset. And I'm thinking about "Oh it's such a nice sunset." Right? And then suddenly my mind immediately goes to, "Oh you know, last time also I saw a sunset like this. Then this happened, then that happened. I took a photo but then now I wonder where that camera is. But that camera had so many other memories as well. I was with this particular friend when I went for this sunset and this person said that and then we had a laugh." Do you realize? This is when the **Thinking Self** takes over, Partha. And while this is happening, I'm actually not observing the sunset that is there.

What do you mean by the **Observing Self** is so much more process related. It's so much about what is happening in that very moment. For example, it's just me saying that, "Oh this is a sunset. Look at the colors that is spreading across the sky. Right? Look at how the light is actually dispersing. Look at that hill over there."

Right? That's all that we're doing. What happens with Partha is, it's a lot more of that Thinking Self that comes to the forward. "But what is the point?" Sometimes, Partha, there is no point. That's what I'm trying to tell you. There is no point. We are enjoying a sunset because we want to enjoy a sunset. There shouldn't be a point about it making my mood happy for the rest of the day. In fact, that shouldn't be the aspect as well. We shouldn't hinge upon one thing that makes the rest of the evening better. But just because there is no point, doesn't mean that the sunset isn't enjoyable.

**Partha:** Yeah, ma’am.

**Krishna:** Are you getting what I'm trying to say? So in that moment, what Partha does is there's so much emphasis on the *next* aspect. Right? There is so much emphasis on "But what's the point?" Sometimes Partha, it's okay if there's no point. There is a reason I wanted to enjoy the sunset even in the first place. Right? And maybe *that* is what the point is. It's not for me to come back and tell that "Oh now I enjoyed that so I should feel better." Absolutely not. But at least in that moment I was able to enjoy. And whenever these things happen, right Partha, this is where we can be a little bit flexible, so as to say. And by... and what I mean by this flexibility, right Partha? Is exactly this. That okay, that other guy comes. The Thinking Self. Let's actually call that the Thinking Self. Right? The Thinking Self comes in and says "Oh but what's the point? It's not going to work." All right. Let's acknowledge it. Let's acknowledge that Thinking Self. But also let me bring into focus, there must be some reason I wanted to go there. What is it that I wanted to go there? And that's exactly what you told me right now. You said "I want to go there so that there is a lot of... you know, maybe it's a place I've always been wanting to go. Maybe it's something that I've always wanted to do." Right? So many of these aspects are also there. And that is what we need to focus on. And that is what makes it even more better for us.

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** So do you see how a little bit of flexibility is something that we can bring in? It's okay. Let that other guy be there, Partha. It's just about "de-centering" it. Let that other thought also be there. "But what is the point?" Okay, fine. That thought came. But also, why is it that I wanted to go there? Can I remind myself of that? Right? And then let's see where our mind goes or how it sort of takes us.

**Partha:** Yeah, ma’am.

**Krishna:** Emotionally how have you been doing though, Partha? Over the last couple of weeks?

**Partha:** I'm doing okay, ma’am. Like there is nothing... nothing that is affecting me so much.

**Krishna:** So much. Mm. Okay.

**Partha:** So yeah. I'm just immersed in many things. Like I started watching a series. Like some Spy Family anime I started watching. So like yeah, but what is happening is even with that I'm getting bored. Like after two minutes I'll just skip it and then I'll go see some Reddit or Instagram, something like that. I feel bad for that. I just want to be do something useful. Instead of doing that I'm just scrolling unwanted things. So yeah, like that is okay. Like I'm just have to be flexible with myself. That is one of the reason I couldn't be happy with myself.

**Krishna:** Mm, okay. And for us for starters, what do you feel this flexibility looks like, Partha? Just for starters.

**Partha:** Flexibility in the sense... I should like see... for example if my friend says these things, I will just tell him to, "It's okay bro, nothing will happen, you can try, you can stop doing that." I can motivate that guy. But if I'm doing myself, I'm just hating myself. Like what is the wrong with me? Like that.

**Krishna:** Mm, okay. So using some of the same statements. Right? And actually that's a good idea, Partha. Maybe some of these statements... see sometimes, right? And it's a very understandable situation as well. In that moment it takes a lot of energy and effort to even come up with some of these statements. Right? So something, Partha, that will be helpful is if you could have visual cues or visual reminders. Say on sticky notes, on post-its or something. Right? Keeping some of these statements that you know is going to help you come out of it. So having that visual... it's not about thinking of that statement at that moment but having it ready so that when I look at it, I know that okay, this is what it is trying to tell me. And I'm able to go back into that. Right? That is what becomes important for us, Partha. Right? How is your sleep and appetite and everything been, Partha?

**Partha:** Uh, sleep is not regular, ma’am. Not proper in the sense I wake up in the middle of the night and then I use phone for like half an hour, one hour. So that is there. But I am feeling okay. Like since I'm in home I can sleep anytime I want. So I'm feeling okay with sleep and food... like I will eat two times or three times. It depends on the... depends on my like how do I feel. But I am eating properly and then I'm taking medicine also regularly. Uh, yeah.

**Krishna:** Mm, okay. All right. So emotionally it's nothing very intense as such but you're able to work with it a little bit, right?

**Partha:** Yeah, sometimes it's coming. But I'm just trying to just... there is no other way right? We can just avoid that guy and then just go somewhere like distract ourselves. That's what I'm trying to do. But I don't know what will happen... like again, I don't know what will happen if I go back to office, something like that.

**Krishna:** Mm, okay. Any reason why you feel in office it's going to get more difficult for you, Partha? When you go back?

**Partha:** Yeah, I have told you like last time right? I'm just keep comparing myself with that girl for everything. Like even something happens in my company, I feel like okay this is how it will be happening in her company also right? Like that. So I don't want to... like since I'm dependent on her for so much long time, whatever... whatever I'm doing it's like I want to show her. I want to tell her "This is what I'm doing" like that. But I don't want to do that. But she made me do that. Like now also... now also I am trying to do the same thing. Like whatever she does in a day, I also want to do like that. But that's not needed, right?

**Krishna:** Mm. Mm. Okay. And in these situations, again, keeping this flexibility that we spoke about in mind, right? What do you think we can do, Partha? Making way for both. Right? Making way for both. That is what specifically for you the flexibility we are working around is. Right? Any idea what we could do for that, Partha? I mean of course I can give you a few ideas but before I also tell you... is there anything that comes to your mind? Because that's also important.

**Partha:** No ma’am, I'm blank.

**Krishna:** Mm. So one thing is similar to, you remember what we spoke about, right? That there is... it's something similar to that going experience right? Instead of saying "What is the point?", there must be some reason you wanted to do it in the first place. Right? So similar to that, Partha, anytime you feel like... you said it's almost like showing it to her, right? Like "I am doing all of this." Right? Let that be there. We are not saying removing that.

**Partha:** No, it's like I want to show everything whatever I'm doing. Like I just want to share everything to her. It was like that. That is the reason I used to take pictures. Lot of pictures. Now also I'm doing the same thing. But I don't have anyone to show to. Like I just want her to be there wherever I go like that. I'm just so obsessed with that person like that. But... but it's not healthy right? Even though she's not... like she's not doing anything good for me whatever it is, I still wanted that person. But when they left... like everything is questionable right? Like whatever happens, everything is a lie. Like all those stuff. Like overthinking things will come right.

**Krishna:** Mm, got it. So everything that you feel you're doing it to show her, right? It's mostly as a... All right. Let that be there. All right? We are not saying... what we're trying to do is "de-center" it a little bit. It's not removing it. All right, there is a part of me that's doing everything to show it to her. All right, let's acknowledge that, Partha. But how is this making me feel? In the sense, say... I'm just giving an example, right? Maybe I'm going to this... you know, in her company also this happens right? And that's the kind of similarity that you're drawing upon. But what I mean in terms of flexibility specifically here Partha, what I also mean is... how is that helping *you* though? It's not *only* for her that you're doing it right? Maybe it's also helping me bond with this colleague of mine. It is helping me develop this skill, right? So that I know that maybe when I go to the US, this is something that will help me. This is something I learnt in college and that is how it is helping me. In between, of course, as you're doing it, your thought might go to her. It is fine. That's what I'm trying to tell you. All right? It is okay that, "But even she is also doing it." All right, let her do it. All right? But what else am I getting from this particular activity or from this company? So de-centering it. Right? We are not talking about removing it off. But keeping it on the side and making space for some other component to come in as well. Right? That is what I mean by this flexibility, Partha. Right? Did you get a sense of what I'm trying to say?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah ma’am. I understand.

**Krishna:** And I think I got the worksheet now. I got the message that you sent the worksheet, right? How did you feel while you were doing that worksheet, Partha?

**Partha:** Uh, I felt like... these are the things... I mean I wrote some things and then I re-wrote again. Like because initially I felt it was not what I wanted. And then I realized, okay what and all made me feel like this, what and all made me sad? I wrote all those stuff. And then I felt like... why? Why I have to be sad for someone who is not even gave me anything? Like not even supported me emotionally. Like yeah, I wrote those things feeling that... I literally said "Okay" for everything. Whatever she does I said "Okay". So like I should have told my opinion also. Like I didn't tell my opinion anytime. Whatever she does I'll say okay. So whatever I wanted to say no to, I wrote there.

**Krishna:** Mm, okay. All right. That's a good way for us to start off with. Right? And maybe in the next session we will open it, maybe I can share my screen and we can just go through it a little together. All right? But also Partha I also did sort of... you know, since it's the New Year's Eve and all of that also, right? It's just I think a moment of reflection for all of us as humans. Right? As for you, for me and all of that. How do you feel this past year has been for you? And the reason I'm asking is because I know it's not been an easy year. I definitely know that it's not been an easy year. And I also know that you have consistently been showing up for yourself. Right? It's been a year of even though there's been so much difficulty, I think Partha's worked so hard in terms of showing up for himself. Showing places in which he can be a little kind towards himself as well. Right? And that's my reflection about how this year has been for you. But what's your reflection?

**Partha:** Uh, yeah. If I think about this year there are lot of good memories to think about. But... but what is happening is I don't remember much of the things. So I just rely on whatever I wrote or whatever I took pictures. So basically if I think about them, it's a good memory. So yeah, this year was better I would say. Because like even though if I was in relationship last two, three years, I was not so much happy. Like at least this time I feel free. Like not only me, most of my friends say the same thing. Like, "Now only I feel like you are free. Before and all you used to be very sad like that." They told that to me.

**Krishna:** Mm. Yeah?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** That's great. That's great. I think that's such a powerful statement right? "I feel free." And remember Partha, for all of us it's a work in progress right? I don't think for all of us we're always going to think about ways in which I can be better today than I was yesterday. Some days are not going to be the same, right? Not every day is going to be the same but "How best can I go about it?" And I think that's where you have also been consistently showing up for yourself. There is something in Partha that also felt that "I want to do this for me." Right? "I want to see how best I can move forward as well." Right? And that's what you have been doing as well, Partha. And I think you really should feel proud about how much work you have put in for yourself. So you can pat yourself on your back for that.

**Partha:** Okay.

**Krishna:** Yeah? All right. So Partha, I will be on leave the next week. So is it okay if we could have a session maybe after the 16th?

**Partha:** Yeah ma’am. Sure.

**Krishna:** You'll be back at work right?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** Okay. So just give me a moment let me just check when we can meet. Okay... How about next Friday? That is 16th.

**Partha:** Yeah ma’am. That's okay.

**Krishna:** 16th works? What time? 10:30 works? Or 10?

**Partha:** 10:30 is fine ma’am.

**Krishna:** 10:30 is a better time? All right. I'll just share that with you right away. Just a moment. You would prefer video call? 30 minutes? Or...

**Partha:** Yeah ma’am. 30.

**Krishna:** 30. Okay, all right. So all right, sharing it for... you said 10:30 right?

**Partha:** Yeah ma’am.

**Krishna:** Yes. So Friday 16th... sorry, 16th 10:30. I've shared it with you Partha. I hope you received the link.

**Partha:** Okay.

**Krishna:** All right. All right then Partha. So take care. Happy New Year in advance. All right? Have a good day, good year and I'll see you on 16th. Anything in between you can drop me a message.

**Partha:** Sure ma’am.

**Krishna:** Yeah?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Krishna:** Okay. Bye bye.

**Partha:** Bye ma’am. Bye.
