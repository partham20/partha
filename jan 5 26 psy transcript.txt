**Partha:** Hi.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Hi, good morning. How are you?

**Partha:** I mean, I'm better I guess.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. What does that... What does better mean? I didn't get your update, that's why.

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll send it actually. I'll send it in just a minute.

**Dr. Lavanya:** You tell me.

**Partha:** Yeah. That is... uh... like less thoughts and then I'm engaging in daily activities... like before. And I was going out with my friends. So, like, since we have... we have had like many people were there, I got very distracted easily. So I couldn't think about the... that girl. Even if I think about that girl on that particular day, the next day I don't remember much about that. I remember only the good things of the... the day. So I don't...

**Dr. Lavanya:** It's not staying in your mind?

**Partha:** Yeah, it's not staying in my mind.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay.

**Partha:** But still, I mean, there are obviously whenever the trigger comes there are some thoughts, but... but it's not very persistent.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay. So you're saying that it's become more manageable, is it? To some extent?

**Partha:** Yeah, some... to some extent it's manageable.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay. So what are the remaining concerns as per you?

**Partha:** Uh, I mean... everybody says that like my face and everything is bulged, like inflammatory like that, something like that.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Swollen, is it?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah, swollen.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Why is that?

**Partha:** That I don't know, ma'am. Like... uh... maybe, I mean... uh... like sudden weight gain is there. Like that is there.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Face is swollen, is it?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** You're noticing a weight gain?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** How much weight gain?

**Partha:** Like... 5 to 6 kilos I guess.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Over how much time?

**Partha:** Uh... three months. Three to four months.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Three to four months. Okay. Okay. Fine.

**Partha:** I am not eating anything much, but still I'm just getting...

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Even though you're feeling you're not so hungry, even then it's happening, is it?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay. Then, uh, what about your activity level? Your lifestyle?

**Partha:** Yeah, I am trying to be as much as active. Like I used to walk and sometimes I go to gym like weekly twice or thrice. So... I'm comparatively active than before.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Good. Good. Alright. Mood wise, how are things?

**Partha:** Mood wise... Yeah, I am not feeling much... like... part of me can say it's very numb. And then part of me can say like... something optimistic I'm feeling like about... like... uh... something good I'm feeling sometimes.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Good in the sense?

**Partha:** Uh, I cannot explain it... how... how it is. But some... some form of... uh... like... that life is worth living. Like something kind of like that.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. So that is a shift from your former... uh... experience, no?

**Partha:** Yes, ma'am.

**Dr. Lavanya:** What changed? What shifted?

**Partha:** Maybe I started to accept that... that... it is good that it happened, maybe like that. That could be one reason.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay.

**Partha:** And then maybe therapy and then maybe medication. Like, so all these things.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm. Okay. So one is you started accepting that it's good that it happened. Then?

**Partha:** Yeah. Then is... like therapy, but I'm not... like I'm not 100% following what she is saying because I couldn't follow 100%.

**Dr. Lavanya:** What happens?

**Partha:** Yeah. And then... yeah, medication I'm taking regularly, but very rarely... like very rarely in the sense like... uh... once in two months or three months I'm skipping it out without knowing it.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay. But overall do you have any side effects or any problems with the medication as of now?

**Partha:** As of now nothing, ma'am. I am okay with everything I guess.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. What about sleep?

**Partha:** Sleep... I am not taking any clonazepam or anything for sleep. I am sleeping good only. But... uh... still that nightmares are there. And then... sometimes... sometimes I stop... like I wake up in the middle of the night and then I'm not sleeping... today also I didn't sleep properly. So... yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** No, no, I am asking is that Lamborexant still there? Or it is not...

**Partha:** No, no, no. I didn't use that. I didn't use for months now.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Oh, you've not used it at all. Okay, good. Okay. Fine. Nightmares are usually at what time? In the day... I mean in the night?

**Partha:** Uh... 3... 3 AM or like... 2:30 to 4. 2 to 4.

**Dr. Lavanya:** 2 to 4, is it? Okay. Okay. And then... I mean, when you kind of try to... uh... what can I say... every single night or how frequently does it happen?

**Partha:** Every single night there will be so many dreams. Like so much bunch of dreams. Which is very vivid and very realistic. And then that makes me feel like... okay... like so many days have passed from yesterday to today. Like since there is so many things no? To think about. So yeah, like that I feel. And then... uh... there are some memory... like memory issues. Like I don't feel like I remember what happened exactly yesterday or day before yesterday. And then... yeah it's very hard for me to remember stuff. Other than that... yeah that is one of the concerning things. Nothing else I have apart from that.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Hard for you to remember stuff basically, right?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay. What are the things that you feel like you're forgetting? give me like an example so that I understand it better.

**Partha:** Example... uh... yeah let's say I went out with friends. I don't remember exactly what... what all we did. Like where we went... like we did this thing and... like if I think too much I can... I can get it. But... yeah, but I usually... like...

**Dr. Lavanya:** Hmm.

**Partha:** Yeah, that feeling of yesterday, today... that... still that... sometimes I will get... dissociated. Like, I don't feel like it's real. What is happening... like... that thought is coming... but it reduced from before. That I can say.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. It's better than... uh... before you're saying. Overall.

**Partha:** Yes, ma'am.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. What about... uh... let's say... uh... how do I put this... what about your... that previous sense of time passing you by? And that whole feeling of not being able to... um... you know... is this the new... first time it's happening or new thing? That kind of a sensation? How is that?

**Partha:** Uh... time in the sense ma'am?

**Dr. Lavanya:** I mean like time is lapsing... loss of... huh.

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah. Uh... yesterday feels like very long back happened. Like that is still there.

**Dr. Lavanya:** It's still there?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. But is it as common or as frequent as before?

**Partha:** Uh... frequent... I mean I just stopped thinking about that much. Because I'm just trying to live in the present. So I'm not focusing on that much. Maybe that could be reason I feel like it's not there.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Fine. Fine. Okay. I think as of now things are definitely in a better shape as compared to before. Right?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Uh, are you meeting with Krishna regularly?

**Partha:** Yes, ma'am.

**Dr. Lavanya:** You're meeting her regularly. Okay. Good. Just discuss with her... you have told her that you are not able to implement all of the things in the therapy?

**Partha:** Yeah, yeah. I have told.

**Dr. Lavanya:** You have told her no? Huh. Because that is the other thing that you need to kind of... uh... discuss and tell properly so that they understand. She knows what to do in terms of... you know... how to handle it and so on. Okay?

**Partha:** Okay.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Yeah. So I think as of now we'll continue the same. My only suggestion to you is to implement a regular sort of exercise regime or something. So that you don't end up in a situation where you are... uh... what can I say... you don't end up in a situation where you are... uh... gaining more weight. Because in general Sertraline and Escitalopram do not cause that much of weight gain. Okay?

**Partha:** Okay.

**Dr. Lavanya:** But if you are noticing a little bit of weight gain or something like that, then it's a good idea to start certain lifestyle modifications because we have finally reached a place of somewhat stability. Okay?

**Partha:** Sure.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Have you been to your hometown recently?

**Partha:** Yeah, ma'am. I was there like last... 10 - 12 days.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. And in spite of that you were able to cope?

**Partha:** Yeah... sometimes it was severe, but I can manage. I can manage it.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Okay. Good. Good then. I think overall things are definitely improving and I think you should also be like happy about that. Okay?

**Partha:** Okay.

**Dr. Lavanya:** So let's wait and watch and let's try to just manage with the current... uh... this thing. Okay? Is that okay for you?

**Partha:** Yeah, ma'am.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Fine. Um... in regards to the nightmares, do you think that if you shift to taking some of the medication in the daytime the nightmares may come down? Do you want to try that and see?

**Partha:** No, I'm taking medication in the day time only, ma'am. I'm taking...

**Dr. Lavanya:** Taking it in the morning only?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Fine. Even then the nightmares are coming.

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Fine. Uh... timings... anything else that could be... anything else that is contributing to it that you know of?

**Partha:** Hmm... no, ma'am.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Not sure no?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Fine. I think as of now let's wait and watch. As long as you are able to be functional, you are able to manage these aspects of your life better, I think these are like a very good sign. Okay?

**Partha:** Yeah.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Fine. Okay man. I think I'll also put in a word to Krishna. I'll send you another prescription and we'll catch up again. If there's any worsening at any point of time you please feel free to reach out. Okay?

**Partha:** Sure, ma'am. Sure.

**Dr. Lavanya:** Okay. Yeah. Bye bye. Take care. Bye.

**Partha:** Thank you.
