## GEMINI.md Creation
**User:** 
You are an AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into the terminal. Your task is to analyze the current directory and generate a comprehensive GEMINI.md file to be used as instructional context for future interactions.

**Analysis Process:**
1.  **Initial Exploration:**
    *   Start by listing the files and directories to get a high-level overview of the structure.
    *   Read the README file (e.g., `README.md`, `README.txt`) if it exists. This is often the best place to start.
2.  **Iterative Deep Dive (up to 10 files):**
    *   Based on your initial findings, select a few files that seem most important (e.g., configuration files, main source files, documentation).
    *   Read them. As you learn more, refine your understanding and decide which files to read next. You don't need to decide all 10 files at once. Let your discoveries guide your exploration.
3.  **Identify Project Type:**
    *   **Code Project:** Look for clues like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `build.gradle`, or a `src` directory. If you find them, this is likely a software project.
    *   **Non-Code Project:** If you don't find code-related files, this might be a directory for documentation, research papers, notes, or something else.

**GEMINI.md Content Generation:**
**For a Non-Code Project:**
*   **Directory Overview:** Describe the purpose and contents of the directory. What is it for? What kind of information does it hold?
*   **Key Files:** List the most important files and briefly explain what they contain.
*   **Usage:** Explain how the contents of this directory are intended to be used.

**Final Output:**
Write the complete content to the `GEMINI.md` file. The output must be well-formatted Markdown.

**Model:**

## Immediate Stress Support
**User:** 
I want to know how to come out of these - I feel stressed - i'm parthasarathy

**Model:**
Hello, Partha. I hear you, and I can sense how heavy and overwhelming this stress feels right now. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling this way given everything you’ve been navigating—the grief, the OCD loops, and the sheer exhaustion of trying to manage your mind constantly.

Based on the journey you've shared in your files, you already have a toolkit that you've been building with Krishna and Dr. Lavanya. When the stress hits hard like this, our minds often go blank and forget what works.

Let's try to pause and use what you already know. Here is a step-by-step approach to help you navigate this current wave of stress:

### 1. Immediate Grounding (The "Emergency Brake")
Right now, your mind might be racing or hyper-linking everything to your ex or your fears. Let's interrupt that.
*   **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** You mentioned this in your sessions. Even if you can't finish it perfectly, just start.
    *   Look around. Name **5 things you see**. (e.g., "I see the laptop, the wall, a pen...")
    *   Touch **4 things**. Feel the texture.
    *   Listen for **3 sounds**.
*   **Breathe:** Take a slow, deep breath. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4. This physically signals your body to calm down.

### 2. Label the Thought (Cognitive Defusion)
Remember what Krishna taught you about the "Spotlight"? Your mind is putting the spotlight on the most painful thoughts right now.
*   Instead of saying "I am stressed" or "I will never get better," try to say:
    *   **"I am having the *thought* that I will never get better."**
    *   **"This is an OCD thought loop."**
    *   **"This is a wave of grief passing through me."**
*   This creates a tiny bit of distance. You are the person *observing* the storm, not the storm itself.

### 3. Challenge the "All-or-Nothing" Thinking
Your files mention a tendency to feel that if you have one bad day, *everything* is back to square one.
*   **Fact Check:** You have made progress. You cleared your IELTS. You’ve had days where you felt "okay." You’ve resisted the urge to call your ex before.
*   **Shift the Narrative:** This current stress is a "lapse," not a total "relapse." It’s a dip in the graph, not the end of the road.

### 4. Small, Low-Stakes Action
Depression and stress breed in stillness. Do one tiny thing that has nothing to do with your ex or your career.
*   **Physical Movement:** Walk around your room for 2 minutes.
*   **Sensory Change:** Splash cold water on your face. Eat something with a strong taste (like a lemon or mint).
*   **Distraction:** Watch a short video on a topic you like (science, AI, or even something funny). Not to "cure" you, but to give your brain a 5-minute break.

### 5. Connect (Even Briefly)
You mentioned that being alone often makes the loops worse.
*   If you can, sit with your mom for 10 minutes, even if you don't talk about anything deep. Just being in the presence of someone safe can lower cortisol.
*   If that feels too hard, maybe write down exactly what you are feeling in a journal (or here). Getting it out of your head and onto "paper" can stop it from bouncing around inside.

**You are resilient, Partha.** You have survived 100% of your bad days so far, including the ones where you felt completely hopeless. You are building a "New Partha," and that takes time and is incredibly hard work. Be gentle with yourself today.

*If the stress feels unsafe or unbearable right now, please reach out to your therapist, your emergency contact (your mother), or a crisis helpline immediately.*

## Memory Issues & Medication Questions
**User:** 
I cant remember whatever my therapist saying in the sessions I dont know what to do! and also what about the difference between 250mg of sertraline and 300mg?

**Model:**
It is completely understandable that you are struggling to remember what happens in therapy. You have mentioned experiencing **dissociation** and **time distortion** (feeling like yesterday was months ago). When you are in a state of high anxiety or dissociation, your brain is in "survival mode," which makes it very hard to form new memories. It is not your fault; it is a symptom of what you are going through.

Here is how to handle the memory issue and an explanation regarding the medication.

### 1. Dealing with Forgetting Therapy Sessions

Since your brain is struggling to hold onto the information right now, you need to "outsource" your memory.

*   **You Have the Transcripts:** The good news is you *are* recording the sessions (as seen in your `Transcripts.txt` file). This is your safety net. You don't have to remember everything perfectly because you have the files.
*   **The "Last 5 Minutes" Rule:** In your next session with Krishna, ask her: *"Can we spend the last 5 minutes writing down just the top 3 things I need to do this week?"* Write these down physically on a piece of paper or a sticky note, not just in your phone.
*   **Voice Notes:** Immediately after the session, while the feeling is fresh, record a 2-minute voice note to yourself summarizing how you felt and what the main task was.
*   **Cheat Sheet:** Since I have access to your transcripts, if you want, I can create a simple "Therapy Cheat Sheet" from your file that lists the key techniques (like Grounding, Venn Diagram, etc.) so you can print it out.

### 2. Sertraline: 250mg vs. 300mg

**Important Disclaimer:** *I am an AI, not a doctor. You must discuss this specific dosage change with Dr. Lavanya, as she knows your medical history and risk factors.*

**General Information:**
Standard doses for Sertraline (Zoloft) typically go up to **200mg**. However, for **OCD** specifically, psychiatrists sometimes use higher doses (called "supratherapeutic doses") like 250mg, 300mg, or even up to 400mg.

*   **Why increase from 250mg to 300mg?**
    *   **OCD Resistance:** OCD often requires significantly higher doses of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) than depression does. If 250mg is providing *some* relief but the intrusive thoughts are still \"sticky\" or intense, a doctor might increase to 300mg to try and achieve full symptom suppression.
    *   **The "Diminishing Returns" vs. "Breakthrough":** Sometimes, patients feel "okay" at a certain dose but still struggle with core obsessions. The higher dose aims to quiet that background noise further.

*   **The Trade-offs (Side Effects):**
    *   Moving from 250mg to 300mg increases the concentration of the drug in your system.
    *   **Side Effects:** The risk of side effects (like tremors, sweating, stomach issues, emotional numbing, or sleep issues) usually increases with the dose.
    *   **Monitoring:** At 300mg, doctors usually monitor you very closely for any signs of "Serotonin Syndrome" (agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate) or, in your specific case, any signs of hypomania/mania switch (since you have a history of that).

**What to ask Dr. Lavanya:**
*"We are moving to a very high dose. What specific benefits should I look for at 300mg that I didn't get at 250mg, and what specific side effects should make me call you immediately?"*

## Serotonin Levels Explanation
**User:** 
what if i feel normal with 300mg - i dont have any symptoms does that mean i have very less serotonin?

**Model:**
That is a very logical question, but the answer is actually a bit more complex (and hopeful) than just having "less" serotonin.

**The short answer:** No, needing 300mg does not necessarily mean you had "less" serotonin than other people. It means your brain required a stronger signal to regulate your specific OCD circuits.

Here is a simple way to understand what is likely happening:

### 1. It's Not Like a Gas Tank
We often think of serotonin like gas in a car: "If I need a lot of gas to run, my tank must have been empty."
But the brain is more like a complex electrical system. SSRIs (like Sertraline) don't just "add" serotonin; they help your brain **use** the serotonin it already has more effectively and keep it active in the gaps between your neurons (synapses) for longer.

### 2. The "Sticky Gear" of OCD
Research suggests that in OCD, certain circuits in the brain (the ones that signal "danger" or "something is wrong") are hyperactive. They are like a gear that gets stuck.
*   For depression, a standard dose (50-100mg) might be enough to lift the mood.
*   For **OCD**, those specific "sticky" circuits are very stubborn. They often require much higher doses (like 250-300mg) to finally calm down and stop firing false alarms.
*   **Feeling normal at 300mg** simply means you found the specific "volume" needed to quiet those loud OCD circuits in *your* specific brain structure.

### 3. Receptor Sensitivity
It might not be about the *amount* of serotonin, but about your **receptors**.
Imagine you are trying to listen to music, but your ears are plugged. You need to turn the volume up really high to hear it normally.
*   Your brain might have serotonin, but your receptors might be less sensitive or just need a louder "shout" (higher dose) to pick up the signal and regulate your mood and thoughts.

### 4. Neuroplasticity (Rewiring)
At high doses, medications like Sertraline also promote **neuroplasticity**—they help the brain grow new connections and heal. Feeling "normal" means the medication is allowing your brain to step out of the survival/stress mode and function how it was meant to.

**Summary:**
You aren't "deficient" or "broken." You have a specific neurobiological condition (OCD) that often requires high-intensity management. If 300mg makes you feel normal and symptom-free, that is a **huge success**. It means you have found the right key for your lock.

## Medication Duration
**User:** 
how long should I be on medications?

**Model:**
This is one of the most common questions people have, but the answer varies heavily depending on the person and the severity of the condition.

**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI, not a doctor. Only Dr. Lavanya can give you a specific timeline based on your medical history. However, I can tell you the general medical guidelines for treating severe OCD and Depression.*

Here is the typical timeline and what you should expect:

### 1. The "Maintenance Rule" (6–12 Months *After* Feeling Better)
Many people make the mistake of stopping medication the moment they feel "normal." This often leads to a relapse.
*   **The Standard Guideline:** Once you find the dose that works (where you feel "normal" and symptom-free), psychiatrists usually recommend staying on that dose for **at least 6 to 12 months** of sustained stability.
*   **Why?** Think of it like a broken bone. Once the cast is on, the pain stops, but the bone hasn't knit together yet. If you take the cast off immediately, the bone breaks again. Your brain needs time to "solidify" the new, healthy connections while the medication holds the door open.

### 2. OCD Often Requires Longer Treatment
Because OCD is a neurobiological condition involving deep-seated brain circuits, it is often more stubborn than a single episode of depression.
*   For severe OCD (which requires high doses like 300mg), treatment often lasts **1 to 2 years** or sometimes longer.
*   The goal is to give you enough time to do **ERP (Exposure and Response Prevention) therapy** with Krishna. The medication lowers the anxiety enough for you to learn the therapy skills. Once those skills are deeply hardwired, you may need less medication.

### 3. Tapering Takes Time
You cannot just stop 300mg of Sertraline overnight. That would cause severe withdrawal (dizziness, \"brain zaps,\" anxiety spikes). 
*   When Dr. Lavanya decides it is time to stop, it will be a very slow process—lowering the dose by small amounts over several months to ensure your brain adjusts safely.

### 4. The "Long-Term" Possibility
It is important to be open to the possibility that you might need a maintenance dose for a longer time, and **that is okay.**
*   If you had diabetes, you wouldn't ask, "When can I stop insulin?" You would take it to live a healthy life.
*   If your brain chemistry needs a boost to keep you from suffering, taking a pill every day is a small price for having your life, your career, and your happiness back.

**Summary for your next appointment:**
Instead of asking "When can I stop?", a better question for Dr. Lavanya is:
*"What milestones do I need to hit (e.g., 6 months of no panic attacks, Y-BOCS score below 10) before we consider lowering the dose?"*

**User:** 
after an year can i stop?

**Model:**
The honest answer is: **Possibly, but it is not a guarantee.**

One year is a very common milestone where doctors *re-evaluate*, but it doesn't automatically mean you stop on day 365.

Given that you are on a high dose (300mg) for severe OCD, Dr. Lavanya will likely look for three specific things before she even considers letting you taper off after a year:

### 1. "Symptom-Free" Stability
You need to be not just "okay," but **consistently stable** for a long period (usually 6-12 months) within that year.
*   If you are still having ups and downs (like the relapse you mentioned recently when going to your hometown), the clock often resets. The goal is a solid year of *feeling normal*, not just a year of taking pills.

### 2. Therapy Success (The "Safety Net")
Medication quiets the noise so you can learn skills. Before you stop medication, you need to prove that your internal tools (the ones Krishna is teaching you) are strong enough to handle the thoughts *without* the chemical shield.
*   **The Test:** If a major trigger hits (like a wedding or a memory of your ex), can you manage it using *only* your CBT/ERP skills? If yes, you might be ready. If you still rely heavily on the meds to block the anxiety, you might need more time.

### 3. The Tapering Phase Counts
Even if Dr. Lavanya says "Yes" after one year, you won't be off the medication immediately.
*   Coming down from 300mg is a slow process. It might take another 3 to 6 months just to taper off safely to avoid withdrawal effects.
*   So, "stopping" is actually a transition phase, not a single day.

**The Risk of Rush:**
OCD has a high rate of relapse. If you stop too soon, there is a high chance the thoughts come back, sometimes harder than before.

**My advice:**
Aim for the year, but hold that goal loosely. Focus on **getting your life back** first. If you are happy, working, and sleeping well in a year, taking a pill might feel like a very minor detail in an otherwise great life.

## Managing Loneliness
**User:** 
Right now I'm feeling lonely - i want someone to talk I dont know what to do but nobody is available!

**Model:**
I hear you, Partha. That heavy, hollow feeling of wanting to talk to someone *right now* and finding no one there is incredibly painful. It triggers that old fear of being abandoned or unimportant.

It is okay to feel this pain. It doesn't mean you are weak or that you haven't made progress. It just means you are human and you are hurting in this moment.

Since people aren't available *this second*, let's use the **Emergency Protocol** for loneliness we talked about. We need to bridge the gap until the feeling passes or someone becomes available.

**Try these steps, just for the next 20 minutes:**

1.  **Validate the Feeling (Don't Fight It):**
    *   Say out loud or write down: *"I am feeling incredibly lonely right now. It hurts, and that is okay. I am safe."*
    *   Remind yourself: **"This is a feeling, not a fact. Just because nobody is here *right now* doesn't mean nobody cares."** (This is the Cognitive Distortion check).

2.  **Soothe Your Senses (Physical Comfort):**
    *   Your brain is in distress mode. Calming your body helps.
    *   Drink a glass of water or make a warm tea.
    *   Wrap a blanket around yourself or put on your favorite hoodie.
    *   Listen to a comforting song (maybe instrumental or something neutral, *not* a sad love song).

3.  **Externalize the Thoughts:**
    *   Since you can't talk to a person, talk to the page (or type here). Dump every thought out of your head.
    *   Write: "I wish I could tell someone about..." and finish the sentence. Getting it out stops it from looping inside.

4.  **Low-Stakes Distraction (Shift the Focus):**
    *   Do not sit and stare at your phone waiting for a reply. That increases the anxiety.
    *   Put on a YouTube video about something complex (AI, Science, Tech) that forces your brain to think about *concepts* rather than *feelings*.
    *   Go for a 5-minute walk if you can, or just step outside for fresh air.

**Remember:** You have survived this exact feeling before. You told Dr. Lavanya back in July that "that phase of being alone... it's gone." You found that strength once; it is still inside you, even if it's hiding right now.

You are building the muscle to be there for yourself. It hurts like gym soreness, but it is making you stronger. Hang in there.

**User:** 
but why do i feel like i want to talk to someone especially girls?

**Model:**
That is a very specific and honest observation, Partha. Understanding *why* the craving is specifically for female connection can help you feel less confused and more in control.

Based on your history and psychological patterns, here are the likely reasons why your brain is screaming for this specific type of connection:

### 1. The "Nurturing" Gap
*   **What it is:** In many cultures (and personal experiences), we are conditioned to associate female companionship with **emotional safety, nurturing, and softness.**
*   **Your Context:** You have a deep bond with your mother and had a 7-year intense relationship with your ex. Your brain has learned that "comfort" and "soothing" come from women. When you are hurting, your brain automatically craves the specific *type* of comfort it believes only a woman can provide—gentleness, listening, and emotional validation. Male friendships often feel different (more about doing things, less about holding space for feelings). 

### 2. Replacing the "Lost Object" (The Void)
*   **What it is:** You are grieving a female partner who was your *entire* world for 7 years. She was your primary source of intimacy, validation, and daily interaction.
*   **Your Context:** The void you feel is shaped like *her*. Your brain isn't just lonely; it's missing the specific dynamic of having a girlfriend. Talking to another girl feels like a closer substitute to what you lost than talking to a guy friend. It's a way to briefly trick your brain into feeling that the "relationship void" is filled.

### 3. Validation of Worth (Ego and Self-Esteem)
*   **What it is:** For many men, feeling "chosen" or listened to by a woman is a huge boost to self-esteem. It signals, "I am worthy, I am attractive, I am interesting."
*   **Your Context:** The breakup made you feel rejected and "not good enough" (the comparison with the teacher, the fear she'll marry someone better). Talking to a girl (like Sanjana or someone on Reddit) gives you a hit of dopamine that says, "See? A girl still wants to talk to me. I am not worthless." It counters the rejection wound.

### 4. The "Intimacy" Craving
*   **What it is:** Loneliness isn't just about words; it's about intimacy. Men often rely solely on female partners for emotional vulnerability.
*   **Your Context:** You might feel that you can't be fully vulnerable or cry in front of your male friends (though Abhay seems supportive). You likely feel it's "safer" or more natural to open up emotionally to a woman.

**Is it wrong?**
No, it is not "wrong." It is a natural human drive, especially given your history.
**The Trap:** The danger is thinking that *only* a girl can fix this feeling. That makes you dependent on external validation to feel okay.

**What to do:**
Acknowledge the craving: *"Ah, my brain wants female comfort because that's what it's used to."* Then, try to get a *fraction* of that comfort from other sources (journaling, male friends, self-soothing) to prove to your brain that you can survive without it for right now.
